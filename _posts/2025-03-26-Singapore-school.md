Title: Singapore school
---

Today we had a parent teacher meeting at the kids' school, and we exchanged thoughts about what we observed. Overall, the experience was better than in the U.S., more rigorous, with room for more innovation.

The kids were obedient and a bit shy, which reflects a respectful culture. It was preferable to the insolent, disruptive behavior we often saw in the U.S. schools. The classrooms here are quieter and more conducive to concentration, setting fertile ground for steady academic progress. There was no disruptive pecking order based on fashion or aggression, unlike American classrooms.

One positive thing we both noticed was the upcoming school camp, which involves two nights and three days of outdoor activities. We appreciated that, recalling our own positive experiences with overnight trips at a young age. We discussed why U.S. public schools rarely organize similar events. It is probably less about liability and more about logistics and cost. In the U.S., private camps manage insurance and logistics by charging parents directly. Here, teachers are certified for activities like rock climbing and canoeing, and there is careful overnight supervision.

As we talked, I sipped a turmeric latte, intentionally ordering the most pretentious item on the menu. Surprisingly, it tasted good, buttery and frothy without any coffee, delivering a healthy dose of antioxidants.

In this blog, I make strong claims intentionally to spark debate. Each bold claim below includes arguments from both sides.

## 1. The Growth Mindset Is Not Fully Reflected in Practice

I argue that the school promotes growth mindset but PSLE still shapes students early.

Counterargument: Singapore ranks highly globally in education benchmarks such as PISA, suggesting effectiveness in identifying academic capabilities at scale.

Counter counterargument: Standardized testing can narrow creativity and capability development, as learning becomes repetitive rather than explorative.

## 2. Leadership Education is Misrepresented

I argue that the school’s concept of leadership, exemplified by being a prefect, leans toward conformity over boldness.

Counterargument: Schools might argue that structured leadership roles like prefects instill discipline and collective responsibility.

Counter counterargument: The current system could build these qualities more by encouraging initiative and experimentation.

## 3. Entrepreneurship Education is Almost Completely Missing

I argue the education system overlooks the entrepreneurial potential of many students.

Counterargument: Singapore has introduced reforms such as SkillsFuture and revisions to PSLE scoring.

Counter counterargument: This leaves more room to grow early entrepreneurial skills and broaden the founder pipeline.

## 4. Actions Speak Louder Than Words

I am giving my kids the option to join an alternative track at bld.ai school. Our school will operate from a rented shop house, with spaces for collaborative learning, yoga, jiu jitsu, and flexible classrooms. The curriculum will integrate rigorous math through Art of Problem Solving, short daily language sessions, and project based learning.

We may welcome other students to join, but there will be significant parental involvement. Parents must mentor, facilitate learning, and participate alongside their children. Each student will work on ventures aimed at real early revenue. By blending practical skills, entrepreneurial thinking, and personalized education, we aim to foster innovation and adaptability.

Lee Kuan Yew’s pragmatism points toward rapid adoption of AI driven personalized learning, shifting from memorization to critical thinking, prioritizing coding and AI education, and retraining teachers. His decisiveness shows how Singapore could lead in educational innovation again. This is the direction we hope to contribute to through bld.ai school.
