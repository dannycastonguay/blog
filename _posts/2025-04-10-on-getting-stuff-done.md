title: On Getting Stuff Done
---

We talk a lot about speed. Not because we’re rushing. But because most people move too slowly. They overthink. They polish. They wait. And in doing so, they waste the most valuable resource they have: time.

Fei and I recently talked about this (probably started with me pontificating and extrapolating). She shared how the fear of imperfection can lead to paralysis. It’s easier to do nothing than to ship something that’s “not quite right.” But that mindset kills momentum. And momentum is everything.

One piece of advice that stuck with us came from [Donovan Sung](https://x.com/donovansung) at [Network School](https://ns.com/): prioritize quantity over quality, especially at the start. Velocity matters. You don’t learn by sitting on something. You learn by shipping, reflecting, adjusting, and shipping again. This applies to everything—content, product, sales, marketing, even internal comms.

Perfectionism doesn’t scale. What scales is clear, fast action.

Your client doesn’t need a perfect deck. They need clarity on pricing, timelines, and deliverables. If you wait three days to polish a “perfect” update, you’re wasting their time. A one-liner on WhatsApp would’ve been better.

Same goes internally. Some people think they can’t reply until they’ve written the ideal message. Wrong. Move fast. Make things happen. Don’t block progress in the name of polish.

We try to give our clients the greatest gift: time. We don’t waste it. We don’t pad meetings with fluff. We don’t bury the lead. We show up with answers, move things forward, and make decisions.

If you’re building anything—content, product, relationships—stop trying to be perfect. Set a target. Hit it. Move again. Even SpaceX, aiming for Mars, breaks it down into daily goals. They ship. So should you.

Done isn’t the enemy of perfect. Done is perfect—because it’s done.

Now go ship something.
