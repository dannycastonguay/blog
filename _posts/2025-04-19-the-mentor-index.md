title: The Mentor Index
---

Over the years I have been mentored by many people, too many to name. You know who you are. I have also had the chance to mentor many others, and you know who you are.

I think about mentoring the way academia uses the H index:

1. Sort your papers from most to least cited.
2. Walk down the list until you reach the first paper whose citation count is less than its position in the list.
3. Your H index is the position just before that.

Example: if your forty eighth paper has forty eight citations and your forty ninth has forty seven, your H index is forty eight.


Mentoring has a similar shape in the number of significant mentor/mentees relationships. Mentor‑index, step by step
	1.	List every mentee you have.
	2.	Write next to each how many mentees they have.
	3.	Sort the list from largest to smallest number of mentees.
	4.	Walk down the list. Stop when the rank number exceeds that person’s mentee count.
	5.	Your mentor‑index is the rank just before you stopped.

Example
You have ten mentees whose own mentee counts are: 15, 12, 11, 9, 9, 6, 5, 3, 2, 1.
Sorted, the sixth mentee has 6 mentees. Rank 6 equals 6, so keep going.
The seventh mentee has 5 mentees. Rank 7 is greater than 5, so stop.
The mentor‑index is 6.

Your capacity to be coached matters. Mentors prefer working with people who listen and act. Good mentors know change is hard, so they stay patient, but they still expect progress. As a mentee your job is to be truthful. Do not misrepresent yourself. Come clean without wasting their time. Keep meetings lean and your progress clear.

As mentors we look for mentees with potential and availability, yet it helps to give anyone willing to listen a chance. Mentees show up in unexpected places. Some found me in formal settings at work or school, others on the mats at Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, and others in random conversations. Staying open to new mentors and new mentees lets us help more people.

I pay my mentors by listening to them. They keep helping because I act on their advice. If you want better mentors, start by mentoring others. Helping people and watching them act makes you better, and that growth attracts mentors. These relationships are some of my most important.

Thank you.


How to get the most from your mentors

1.	It’s easier to be good than to look good
2.	It’s better to come clean early than to hold back
3.	Give mentors leverage by not wasting their time
4.	Pay them by acting on their advice and showing progress
5.	Mentor others and pay it forward to deepen your own growth
7.	Stay open. Mentors and mentees often appear in unexpected places, so be ready to learn and ready to help anywhere.
