title: Be the Change

Be the change you want to see in the world.

We all have enormous room to improve how we communicate, rooted deeply in our sense of belonging and the permission we grant ourselves to act.

Unfortunately, many of us were raised in educational systems that taught us to be meek, quiet, small, and obedient. We learned not to question authority or speak up because resources were limited. One teacher managing 30 students created a necessary but problematic asymmetry.

This conditioning isn’t helpful if you aspire to create meaningful change in the world. If your goal is to make a significant impact (to step outside your comfort zone and actively improve the world) you can’t afford to remain small. While personal growth and inner peace are valuable, true change requires stepping out into the world with confidence, presence, and authenticity. This doesn’t mean arrogance. It means actively engaging, contributing, and showing others that you are present and committed.

A story shared by collague years ago highlights this beautifully. This guy was U.S. military contractor who, upon arriving at a base in Iraq, found an empty gym and started training alone. Soon after, a group of fit, elite soldiers entered. Feeling out of place, he started to leave until the commanding officer stopped him and asked why he was leaving. After explaining, the officer replied something along the lines of “Son, put your kit down. You’re going to train with us. From now on, every room you enter, every meeting you join, be your best self. You belong.” Powerful stuff.

This story resonates with advice I’ve often given my teams. I encourage everyone to engage actively within the first 5 minutes of any meeting. Ask questions, contribute ideas, or even take simple actions like writing on the whiteboard. By the 10 minute mark, you should have committed to an action that improves the group’s outcome, perhaps a follow-up email or a helpful insight. Such practices foster an active mindset, countering ingrained habits of meekness and passive communication.

Another key piece of advice I frequently share: don’t fear being highly responsive. Don’t delay responses in search of perfection. People appreciate frequent updates and swift responsiveness far more than perfect yet delayed replies. This holds true professionally and personally.

Interestingly, this approach is particularly important for technical folks. These guys and gals often strive for “DRY” (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code (avoiding repetition for efficiency). However, human interactions aren’t like code. People forget, get busy, or miss details. Leaders, especially, benefit from repeated communication across multiple channels. If a senior leader sends an email, respond promptly and follow up with a text. Regularly surface your updates—not to annoy, but to demonstrate clarity, commitment, and care.

Lastly, solve problems fully whenever possible. Leaders prefer complete solutions, not multiple openended options. Don’t hesitate to present fully resolved problems. This isn’t about taking credit or stepping on toes but about efficiency and effectiveness. Choose the best solution, execute it, and move forward.

Be proactive, responsive, confident, and thorough. This is how you start to become the change you wish to see in the world.
