title: Entrepreneurs Capture the In-Between
---

The word entrepreneur comes from the French word entreprendre. “Entre” means between, and “prendre” means to take, so literally it means “to take between.” It refers to recognizing and capturing an opportunity that exists between two things.

A helpful way to visualize entrepreneurship is with the metaphor of skirmishers in warfare. Skirmishers were specialized units who advanced ahead of the main army to capture critical positions, such as hills, before the larger forces could safely move forward. Capturing these positions involved significant risk, but a small, agile group could hold them, creating strategic advantage for the larger army to safely follow.

Most people stay safely with the larger group, similar to the main army. Entrepreneurs behave more like skirmishers. They identify opportunities early, take thoughtful risks, and create new possibilities for others to follow.

Entrepreneurship is a critical role. It is a role best suited to people who have created enough momentum and mental space in their lives, not necessarily wealth, but enough cognitive freedom and clarity to see opportunities before others do. Entrepreneurs must be competent across multiple skills, not perfect, but capable enough to act decisively, adapt quickly, and navigate uncertainty with limited resources.

My own role is as a meta entrepreneur. I create ventures myself, but my main goal is helping others become entrepreneurs. By supporting and training people to effectively recognize and seize opportunities, I extend my impact far beyond what I could achieve alone.

Consider eczema. A dermatologist typically prescribes creams, treating symptoms without addressing root causes. An entrepreneurial mindset might look deeper, examining diet, allergies, or even unconventional treatments like fecal transplants to restore gut microbiome health. These approaches are not random guesses; they are thoughtful experiments informed by careful observation and learning.

My daughter Pascale has eczema. It is likely connected to her digestion, immune responses, and allergies. An entrepreneurial approach would not simply accept standard treatments, but would test new ideas, learn continuously, and refine approaches based on results.

That is the essence of entrepreneurship: identifying opportunities, thoughtfully taking risks, and continuously learning through deliberate experimentation.
