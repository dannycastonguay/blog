title: Laughing Beyond the Overton Window
---

I think that as parents, older siblings, and role models, one of the most important things we can do is nurture a childâ€™s sense of humor.

Humor is often how we say what feels hard to say when we are serious. Much of life stays serious, focused, and inside the [Overton window](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overton_window) of what society accepts.

Humor, in a way, works like a mild psychoactive drug.

Consciousness-altering drugs are powerful chemicals that change how we see the world. Some cult leaders or gurus reach altered states through drugs, yet most governments forbid them, perhaps to protect social cohesion. High functioning societies that create wealth depend on that cohesion. Improvement is always possible, but a nation probably does not need every teenager experimenting with LSD or marijuana in order to progress.

Comedy is a bit like wholesome drug. Humor lets us say things that would seem surprising or off limits in normal talk, yet through laughter we can teach and gently shift perspective. It offers a safe path to learn and see differently.

As educators and parents we must welcome humor. The worst response is to be severe, ignore jokes, and block kids from expressing their wit. Their jokes show the conclusions they draw about life, and they carry messages worth hearing.

When we welcome their humor we can refine it through dialogue. A joke that seems funny today may not be funny tomorrow, not because we banned it but because together we grew and saw it with clearer eyes.

I am proud that my kids know advanced humor. We have spent many hours laughing together and watching a wide range of shows. They enjoy lighter comedies like Brooklyn Nine Nine and Ted Lasso and they also appreciate darker humor in What We Do in the Shadows. Dark comedy matters because many modern philosophers are comedians who deliver sharp messages in an acceptable way.

Comedians such as Joe Rogan, Dave Chappelle, and Jerry Seinfeld shape politics and culture even when they avoid direct political commentary. They often explore ideas that reach beyond current debates and speak to shared human concerns.

I long for more great comedians who will bring us stories, cartoons, shows, films, and illustrations. While fresh classics are rare, the existing catalog forms a living record of modern values and philosophies that we can watch, share, and discuss with our children.

The lesson is simple: spend time developing your kidsâ€™ humor. Listen, laugh, and you will uncover insights that make them and you better.
