Title: How I Build with AI
---

In the last 20 days, I've created around 8+ apps, each in a matter of hours. For example, [OOPSDEAD](https://oopsdead.com/), [closet.gg](https://closet.gg/), [OpenMagic Pro](https://openmagic.pro/), [openfantasy.app](https://openfantasy.app/), [sourceOS](https://sourceos.org/), and [policyOS](https://policyos.org/). I even created two concepts for generative AI NSFW websites: [NSFW1](https://fantasizehub.ai/) and [NSFW2](https://pornhub.fantasizehub.ai/).

Here's roughly how I went about it. I'm not sure if I'll be updating this post in the future, so it's possible the websites above won't age well.

1. **Idea Generation**
   I start by brainstorming ideas using a voice recording app on my phone.

2. **Project Creation with [BLD.AI](https://bld.ai)**
   I upload the voice note to [bld.ai](https://bld.ai), which creates a structured project for me.
   If needed, I refine the output using [ChatGPT 4.5](https://chat.openai.com).

3. **Prototype Development with [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev)**
   I paste the project brief into [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev), which generates a front-end prototype.
   - Frontend: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
   - Backend: [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
   - Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
   - Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

4. **AI Integration**
   For AI functionality, I deploy models using [Dokku](https://dokku.com) on a [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/cloud) cloud server.
   - LLM: [OpenAI GPT-4o](https://platform.openai.com)
   - Image: [Stable Diffusion via PromptEngineering](https://promptingguide.ai)
   - Voice: [ElevenLabs](https://www.elevenlabs.io)

5. **Project Management and Scaling with [BLD.AI](https://bld.ai)**
   I use [bld.ai](https://bld.ai) to organize my work. If the project is successful, I use it to scope work, set budgets, and collaborate with top talent.

I'm having fun. I hope you will too.
