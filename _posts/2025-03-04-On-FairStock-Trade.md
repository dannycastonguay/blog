I'm the CEO of both [bld.ai](https://www.bld.ai) and [FairStock.Trade](https://fairstock.trade), companies that complement each other in powerful ways. Through bld.ai, I've overseen more than 500 projects generating over $50 million in revenue, primarily serving enterprises through professional services in engineering, design, data science, and consulting. This experience has given me deep insights into how innovation is funded and executed at both enterprises and startups.

### 1. Funding Humanity’s Kardashev Future

Considering humanity’s trajectory on the [Kardashev scale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhFK5_Nx9xY) (where we become interplanetary and eventually build structures like a Dyson sphere) I believe that the most significant future value will not come from today's corporate giants but from tomorrow's entrepreneurs, many of whom may still be children today. Investing in these future leaders, and helping them become influential and successful CEOs, represents the greatest long-term opportunity.

Venture capital today faces significant limitations. It's often opaque, illiquid, and inefficient, typically benefiting later-stage investors rather than early visionaries. Exceptional cases exist, such as [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com), which successfully identified and accelerated companies like Airbnb, Stripe, Coinbase, and Dropbox. YC excels by spotting founders early, providing mentorship, and efficiently connecting them to investors.

### 2. Taste CEOs

FairStock.Trade is designed to push this model further by identifying and empowering "[Taste CEOs](https://blog.dannycastonguay.com/the-taste-CEO/)": individuals distinguished by their extraordinary ability to influence audiences. We're building a platform tailored specifically to support these CEOs. Imagine individuals like [Mr. Beast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MrBeast), who commands a massive global audience, or intellectual influencers like [Balaji](https://balajis.com), whose smaller audience wields significant financial influence. While these examples illustrate the type of talent we target, they highlight the vision we are currently building toward, rather than current platform users.

Even more exciting is identifying future Taste CEOs who may currently be teenagers or even younger, yet already show exceptional potential.

### 3. High quality signals

FairStock.Trade automates data integration across numerous platforms, collecting signals such as:

1. Social Media Engagement: YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook
2. Content Performance Metrics: YouTube Analytics, TikTok Analytics, Google Analytics, Patreon
3. Professional and Academic Influence: Google Scholar citations, ResearchGate
4. Operational Metrics: QuickBooks, Xero, Stripe, Salesforce, GitHub, LinkedIn, Glassdoor
5. Market Analytics: Crunchbase, Preqin, PitchBook, CB Insights
6. Employee and Company Sentiment: Glassdoor reviews, Indeed ratings

An intuitive AI agent guides founders through the OAuth-enabled connection of these diverse data sources, creating an automated, rich, real-time data profile that investors can leverage. This provides significantly deeper insight compared to traditional market analytics, allowing founders to engage in continuous fundraising rather than discrete, episodic capital raises.

### 4. Auctions

FairStock.Trade supports two primary auction types:

- **Dutch Auctions**: Shares from the company’s treasury sold at descending prices until fully subscribed, automating continuous capital raises.
- **Seller-Price Auctions**: Early shareholders and employees set desired sale prices for their shares, offering immediate liquidity opportunities and incentivizing talent.

Additionally, FairStock.Trade introduces the innovative concept of ETF-like funds composed of venture capital portfolios or influential individual investors. Traditionally, individuals need extensive institutional careers to become recognized investors. Our platform enables talented stock pickers to rapidly build transparent investment track records and establish ETF-style funds, democratizing access and enabling investors to allocate capital more effectively.

Our ambition is infrastructure-level: minimal friction, maximal transparency, and interactive-broker-level transaction fees—pennies per share—to facilitate significant, efficient capital flows. We're starting with U.S.-based startups and accredited investors to comply with regulatory frameworks, with a clear vision for global expansion to financial centers such as Singapore, London, and Tokyo.

Importantly, everything we’ve built around traditional shares seamlessly extends into Web 3.0 and tokens.

### 5. Web 3.0 and Tokenization

Every mechanism we’ve created for managing equity—vesting schedules, governance processes, auctions for transparent valuation, and continuous liquidity—also applies directly to Web 3.0 tokens. The primary innovation of FairStock.Trade lies in combining the rigorous documentation, governance structures, and market transparency typical of Web 2.0 equities with the speed and efficiency inherent in blockchain-based tokens.

Currently, token markets provide liquidity and efficiency but often fall short on transparency and clear documentation standards, leading to uncertainty or speculative risks. FairStock.Trade bridges this gap by offering one unified platform that seamlessly integrates traditional equities and blockchain tokens, maintaining rigorous documentation, clear governance, and accurate mark-to-market valuations. This allows founders to initially set up traditional corporations and, when ready, effortlessly issue tokens to reward early backers, manage loyalty points, or engage with communities, all within the same robust infrastructure. Investors benefit from both speculative opportunities in tokens and stable long-term investment opportunities in traditional shares under one transparent umbrella.

### 6. Numerical Example

Consider a hypothetical startup:
1. Initial valuation: $10 million
2. The founder uses FairStock.Trade to automate monthly auctions, planning to sell 1% each month.
3. In month one, a Dutch auction starts at $200,000 for 1%. Investors bid early, and the full 1% is bought at $180,000, setting the company's valuation at $18 million.
4. Month two auction begins at $250,000 (based on rising investor interest), selling at $190,000, increasing valuation to $19 million.
5. By month six, continuous auctions and transparent data increase market confidence, resulting in a valuation rise to $30 million, and 1% sells easily at $300,000.
6. Early investors and employees who initially bought shares at $180,000 per 1% can now choose to sell their shares via a Seller-Price auction at current valuations, realizing liquidity without waiting years for an IPO.

Compare this to traditional venture capital:
- Typically, startups spend months fundraising, limiting CEO productivity.
- Investors lock their capital for 7-10 years, waiting for liquidity events like acquisitions or IPOs.
- FairStock.Trade drastically reduces both fundraising and liquidity timelines, creating a dynamic, real-time market.

FairStock.Trade isn't merely a marketplace—it's a paradigm shift. If you're excited by transparent investing in influential founders and future-focused companies, join us on this transformative journey.

Whether it’s through traditional shares or blockchain tokens, we’re building the future of transparent, efficient, and flexible investing.
