title: On Glassdoor
---

If you search for reviews about bld.ai on platforms like Glassdoor, you'll notice some very negative feedback. Until now, I’ve chosen not to respond, partly because I find those websites somewhat disingenuous. I believe strongly in transparency but also accountability through identity. If someone were exposing unethical behavior as a whistleblower, anonymity might make sense—but this is not the case with bld.ai.

We have consistently been extremely transparent. Every work log, all revenue, and detailed expenses were openly visible to our entire team for a long period. We’ve clearly communicated significant changes, like transitioning from an employee to a contractor model, always ensuring fairness. I’ve personally responded openly to anyone who contacted me via email or WhatsApp.

We haven’t underpaid anyone. Payments are objectively calculated by software, without bias. We experimented occasionally by paying certain individuals more than calculated, as part of efforts to improve our processes. Many experiments didn't succeed, and reverting to standard payments understandably disappointed those affected. However, disappointment shouldn’t lead to public shaming or misrepresentation.

That said, I acknowledge we’ve made mistakes, and many Glassdoor criticisms are justified. Here is my candid response to common criticisms:

1. Late or delayed salaries: If you were employed by one of our partner companies, delays might have happened. However, bld.ai credits funds promptly to partner companies. Payments from bld.ai are always timely.
2. Poor internal communication: This is partially true. Our operational team responds swiftly to urgent matters, but as CEO, I haven't frequently communicated company-wide. Improving this could be beneficial.
3. Chaotic and emotional management: Our ops team is professional and organized. As CEO, I admit to sometimes being chaotic, irrational, or emotional. If unresolved issues remain, please contact me directly.
4. Lack of structure, mentorship, and guidance: We do not have employees. If you're part of a partner company, please address this with their leadership. Direct contractors to bld.ai do not receive mentorship but should always have clear project expectations. If unclear, notify your project admin immediately.
5. Stability concerns: As a direct contractor, instability is real. Project availability depends on clients. Joining a partner company can provide more stability.
6. Unprofessionalism, nepotism, lack of HR support: Please directly email me (d@bld.ai) or the board (board@bld.ai) regarding professionalism or nepotism concerns. We don't have an HR department since we don't have employees, but we have comprehensive policies and agreements.
7. Unclear or changing rules: Our core rules haven't significantly changed in years, though instability can occur if client projects stop. Partner companies offer stability but lower immediate compensation.
8. Difficulty securing projects: There's no guarantee of projects. Until recently, bld.ai hadn't invested in sales and marketing, relying primarily on referrals and my personal efforts. Project sourcing is challenging, and we’re aware improvements are needed.
9. Questionable business practices: Please provide specific examples directly so we can address them appropriately.

Despite criticisms, there’s also substantial positive feedback:

- Flexible hours, remote work, competitive regional compensation.
- High autonomy and opportunities for professional growth.
- Transparency in operational and financial matters.
- Talented, motivated colleagues creating a positive work environment.

Candidly, I do want to fix bld.ai and whoever wrote really long and emotional review clearly cared. For that, thank you.

I'll keep updating this post as new reviews come in but feel free to contact me directly too.
