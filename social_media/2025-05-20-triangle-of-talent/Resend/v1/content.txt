SUBJECT: Unleashing Superstars: The Triangle of Talent

Gary Tan, president of Y Combinator, recently highlighted Shaan Puri's "Triangle of Talent" on X. This framework reshapes how we view management by revealing that every employee is fundamentally a problem solver. The true stars are those who consistently tackle the most critical issues.

Inspired by this idea, I teamed up with Yudha, an illustrator from Yogyakarta, Indonesia, part of the bld.ai network. Yudha is pushing the boundaries by integrating AI into his art process, moving beyond traditional tools like Photoshop. Our study is exploring how AI can enhance the creativity and productivity of illustrators, similar to the transformations seen in programming and other fields.

Yudha's AI-augmented interpretation of the Triangle of Talent offers a fresh take. We've even turned these illustrations into a short video, complete with a voiceover that's my voice synthesized by ElevenLabs, from a script generated by ChatGPT 4.5.

Now, let me take you on a journey with Milo, a little boy who embodies this framework. 

- At first, Milo struggled with even simple tasks. He felt lost when asked to build a block tower (Level 1 – Useless).
  
- As he grew, Milo learned to follow clear instructions from his mom to build the tower step-by-step (Level 2 – Task Monkey).

- Soon, Milo started solving puzzles on his own, though he needed guidance on which puzzle to tackle (Level 3 – Problem Solver).

- Then, Milo became a team player, organizing his friends to solve puzzles faster together (Level 4 – Systems Thinker).

- Finally, Milo became adept at identifying and solving the most important puzzles, becoming a true superstar (Level 5 – Superstar).

This story of Milo mirrors the essence of the Triangle of Talent. Leaders seek superstars like Milo who can identify and solve the right problems, driving success for their teams and companies.
