Ever wondered what makes some employees stand out? Shaan Puri’s "Triangle of Talent" reveals that it's all about problem-solving. This simple framework, shared by Gary Tan of Y Combinator, highlights how the best employees are those who identify and tackle the most critical issues.

Yudha’s AI-enhanced illustration of the Triangle of Talent offers a fresh take on this concept. We've also created a short video with an AI-generated voiceover that sounds remarkably like mine, thanks to a script crafted by ChatGPT 4.5.
