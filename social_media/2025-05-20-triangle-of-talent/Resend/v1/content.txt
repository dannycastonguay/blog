SUBJECT: Unlocking the Secrets of the Triangle of Talent

Gary Tan, president of Y Combinator, recently highlighted Shaan Puri’s *Triangle of Talent*. This framework offers a fresh perspective on management, emphasizing that every employee is a problem solver. The most valuable ones are those who consistently identify and address critical issues.

Inspired by this, I teamed up with Yudha, an illustrator from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Yudha is pushing the boundaries by integrating AI tools into his creative process, moving beyond traditional software. Our study explores how AI can enhance human creativity, much like it has transformed productivity for other professions.

Yudha's AI-augmented illustration of the Triangle of Talent breathes new life into this concept. We've even crafted a short video with a synthesized voiceover—featuring my voice, generated by ElevenLabs from a script by ChatGPT 4.5.

Now, let's dive into a story about a boy named Milo, who scaled the levels of talent:

- **Level 1 – Useless**: Milo struggled with basic tasks, feeling unsure.
- **Level 2 – Task Monkey**: He learned to follow instructions and stack blocks.
- **Level 3 – Problem Solver**: Milo solved puzzles independently, needing only a nudge on which puzzle to tackle.
- **Level 4 – Systems Thinker**: He collaborated with friends, enhancing their puzzle-solving speed.
- **Level 5 – Superstar**: Milo identified and solved the most important puzzles, becoming a team leader.

This story resonates because those who solve the right problems are invaluable. Leaders seek out these "superstars" to drive success.
