SUBJECT: Unleashing the Power of the Triangle of Talent

Ever wondered what makes an exceptional employee? 

Gary Tan, president of Y Combinator, recently highlighted Shaan Puri’s *Triangle of Talent*. This framework is transforming management by emphasizing employees as problem solvers. The standout performers? Those who tackle the most critical issues head-on.

Inspired by this, I teamed up with Yudha, a talented illustrator from Yogyakarta. He's pioneering new ways of blending AI with art, moving beyond traditional tools like Photoshop. Our study is unveiling how AI can amplify human creativity, similar to its impact on programmers and legal professionals.

Yudha’s unique take on the Triangle of Talent, enhanced with AI, brings a fresh visual spin. We've taken this concept further, creating a short video with a synthesized voiceover. You won't believe it's my voice, crafted by ElevenLabs from a ChatGPT 4.5-generated script!

Now, let me take you on a journey with a little boy named Milo. 

- At first, Milo struggled with simple tasks (Level 1 – Useless). 
- With guidance, he built a tower of blocks (Level 2 – Task Monkey). 
- Soon, he solved puzzles independently (Level 3 – Problem Solver). 
- Milo then helped friends solve puzzles faster (Level 4 – Systems Thinker). 
- Finally, he chose the most important puzzles, becoming a superstar (Level 5 – Superstar).

Milo’s story shows the value of people who can identify and solve the right problems. Leaders seek out such superstars to drive success. 

Let’s learn and grow like Milo to achieve great things together!
