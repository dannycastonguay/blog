SUBJECT: Unlock Your Potential with the Triangle of Talent

Gary Tan, the president of Y Combinator, recently spotlighted Shaan Puri's "Triangle of Talent"—a framework that revolutionizes our approach to management by emphasizing that every employee is a problem solver at heart. The most valuable team members are those who can identify and tackle the most pressing challenges.

Inspired by this, I teamed up with Yudha, an illustrator from Indonesia. He's pushing the boundaries by incorporating AI into his creative process, much like it has transformed fields like programming and law. Together, we created a unique illustration of the Triangle of Talent that's both simple and profound, augmented by AI.

But we didn't stop there. We took it a step further by creating a video with a synthesized voiceover, which is actually my voice, generated by ElevenLabs using a script from ChatGPT 4.5. 

Check out the video and share your thoughts!
