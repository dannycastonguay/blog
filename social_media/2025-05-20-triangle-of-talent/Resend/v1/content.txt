SUBJECT: Discover the Secret Behind the Triangle of Talent

Have you ever wondered what truly makes an employee invaluable? According to Shaan Puri's *Triangle of Talent*, it's all about being a problem solver. The best employees are those who consistently identify and tackle the most crucial issues. 

Gary Tan of Y Combinator recently highlighted this simple yet profound framework, likening it to an engineering diagram due to its straightforward brilliance.

Inspired by Shaan's insights, I've teamed up with Yudha, a talented illustrator from Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Yudha is pushing the boundaries by integrating AI tools into his creative process, moving beyond traditional software. We're exploring how AI can enhance artistic productivity, similar to its impact on programmers and other professionals.

Yudha's AI-enhanced illustration of the Triangle of Talent offers a fresh perspective. We've even turned these visuals into a short video with a synthesized voiceover. Fascinatingly, the voiceover features my voice, crafted by ElevenLabs from a script generated by ChatGPT 4.5.
