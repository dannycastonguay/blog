🌟 How do you become a problem-solving superstar? 🌟

Imagine transforming from a "task monkey" to a "systems thinker" and finally, a "superstar" just like Milo! 🚀

Gary Tan of Y Combinator recently highlighted Shaan Puri’s *Triangle of Talent,* a powerful framework that emphasizes the importance of employees who identify and tackle crucial problems. Inspired by this, I teamed up with Yudha, an illustrator experimenting with AI, to bring this concept to life. 🎨✨

Here are 3 key takeaways:
1️⃣ **Problem Solvers Shine**: The most valuable team members don't just follow instructions—they proactively identify and solve important issues. 🧠
2️⃣ **AI as a Creative Ally**: Our project explores how AI can enhance human creativity, making illustrators and other professionals even more effective. 🤖+🎨
3️⃣ **Visual Storytelling**: Yudha’s AI-augmented illustrations bring the *Triangle of Talent* to life, showing how anyone can evolve from "Useless" to "Superstar"! 🌈
