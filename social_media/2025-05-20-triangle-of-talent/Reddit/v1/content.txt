Gary Tan from Y Combinator recently highlighted Shaan Puri’s "Triangle of Talent," a framework for identifying and nurturing top talent within organizations. This concept revolves around the idea that the most valuable employees are those who can consistently identify and solve critical problems.

**Key Points:**

- **The Triangle of Talent:**

  2. **Level 2 – Task Monkey:** Able to follow clear instructions to complete tasks.
  3. **Level 3 – Problem Solver:** Can independently solve given problems.
  4. **Level 4 – Systems Thinker:** Collaborates and creates plans that enhance group efficiency.
