**Key Points:**

- **The Triangle of Talent**: An essential framework that emphasizes the role of employees as problem solvers. Higher value is placed on those who consistently identify and tackle critical issues.
  
- *Simple Yet Powerful*: The framework is akin to an engineering diagram, cutting through to the core of effective management.
  
- **Levels of Talent**:
  1. **Level 1 – Useless**: Initial stage where the individual struggles with basic tasks.
  2. **Level 2 – Task Monkey**: Ability to follow instructions but still requires guidance.
