"A professional, realistic image of a rollercoaster showing the highs and lows to represent the unpredictable nature of life. Include elements like a person inside the rollercoaster, showing expressions of joy and fear to represent the ups and downs. Add a background of a calendar or clock to signify daily life and time passing. Use a vibrant color scheme for the rollercoaster with a clean, modern design for the background. The image should clearly communicate the concept of managing expectations and building resilience amidst life's ups and downs in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
