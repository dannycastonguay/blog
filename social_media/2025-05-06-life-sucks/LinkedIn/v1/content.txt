We often chase happiness, only to find it leads to addiction and anxiety. Instead, consider this: life inherently has its ups and downs. By managing expectations and embracing resilience, we can navigate life's challenges more effectively. 

I've found that accepting life's imperfections and seeking manageable challenges, like an extra yoga session, builds resilience and fortitude. This mindset not only aids personal growth but also fosters a resilient community around us.
