**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic illustration of a person navigating a path with ups and downs, representing the journey of life. The path should show obstacles or challenges representing low points, and open, smooth stretches representing better days. The person should be shown actively engaging with these obstacles - pushing, climbing, or overcoming them. Include elements like a yoga mat or helping hand to symbolize personal growth activities the person does to build resilience. Use a color scheme that is bright and vibrant yet soothing, with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the idea of embracing life's struggles and building resilience through them, as outlined in the social media content. It should inspire viewers to accept life's imperfections and find growth in their struggles, making it appealing and valuable for Instagram's visually-focused audience." 

For Instagram enhancement: "Ensure an Instagram-worthy aesthetic with bright, vibrant colors and high visual appeal. The image should be in a square or vertical format, optimized for Instagram feed display. It should have a visually striking design that encourages engagement and sharing, with a modern, aspirational aesthetic that fits Instagram's visual culture. The image's quality should be polished and professional, suitable for lifestyle and inspiration content, and be story-worthy, motivating users to share it in their stories."
