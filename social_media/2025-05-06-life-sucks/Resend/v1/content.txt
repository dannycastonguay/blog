SUBJECT: Why It's Okay If Life Isn't Always Perfect

Hey there,

Ever feel like life just isn't what you imagined? Believe me, I get it—and that's totally okay.

Here's a fresh perspective: Instead of chasing constant happiness, which can lead to *burnout and disappointment*, I focus on managing expectations. I aim for my days to be a solid five or six. Anything more is a bonus! This approach helps me avoid those dreaded zero days where everything feels overwhelming.

Here’s how I do it:

- I expect life to have its ups and downs. It makes the tough days a little easier to handle.
- I embrace challenges, sometimes even seeking them out. Yes, a bit of pain can build resilience!
- On good days, I push myself—whether it’s through an extra yoga session or helping others more than usual.

Over time, this habit has made me stronger and more capable of facing bigger challenges. Plus, I've noticed that resilience is *contagious*. Surrounding myself with resilient people means we can all keep pushing forward, together.

Cheers to embracing the imperfections!

P.S. Share your thoughts or stories about resilience. I'd love to hear them!
