🚀 Are you borrowing code or borrowing insight? Let's dive into the hidden world of AI theory debt! 🤔✨

In the age of AI-augmented coding, it's easy to get swept away by instant results. But what happens when you don't understand the underlying code? That's where AI theory debt sneaks in! 💡

🔹 **Maintain the Balance**: Use AI for scaffolding or prototyping, but not for building entire modules. Think of AI as your assistant, not the lead architect. 🏗️

🔹 **Document the Journey**: Always annotate and document the metaphors, invariants, and edge cases. These breadcrumbs will guide you through the labyrinth of code when tweaks are needed. 📝

🔹 **Build the Theory**: Go beyond the surface. Draw diagrams, write narratives, and run experiments to truly internalize how your system maps to the real world. 🌍

AI theory debt is insidious because it’s invisible until it strikes. Don't just settle for working code—seek the understanding behind it.
