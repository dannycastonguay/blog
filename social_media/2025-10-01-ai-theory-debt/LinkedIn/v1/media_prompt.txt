"A professional, realistic illustration of a software developer at work, surrounded by floating AI-generated code pieces, showing the complexity and confusion that arises from AI theory debt. Include visual elements like disconnected code pieces, a 'borrowed insight' symbol, and symbols of chaos (like a puzzle missing pieces) to represent the challenges of not fully understanding the AI-generated code. Also, incorporate elements representing the strategies for managing theory debt, such as document icons for annotation, a hand-drawn diagram for building a comprehensive theory, and a refactoring symbol. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with contrasting colors to highlight the chaos and clarity aspects. The image should clearly communicate the unseen burden and challenges of AI-generated code and the importance of thorough understanding for effective management, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media, specifically LinkedIn's professional environment."
