**Version 1: Thoughtful and Insightful Tone**

How often do we consider the unseen burden of AI-generated code? ü§î While AI tools enable rapid development, they can also lead to a hidden challenge: AI theory debt. Unlike technical debt, theory debt arises when we lack a deep understanding of the code's principles. To avoid this, we must document, refactor, and build a comprehensive theory. How do you manage your AI theory debt? Let's discuss. 

**Version 2: Self-Deprecating Tone**

Ever felt like AI coding is a bit like magic, only to realize later you've conjured more chaos than clarity? üôÉ That's AI theory debt for you. We might skip the hard thinking, but it catches up when tweaks lead to disasters. My strategy? More annotations, fewer assumptions. How do you cope when your AI code starts acting like a rebellious teenager?

**Version 3: Witty and Short**

AI code: fast, magical, and sometimes a bit clueless. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú® Meet AI theory debt, the sneaky sibling of technical debt. It's like a puzzle missing its picture guide. More code comprehension, less code confusion! How do you keep your AI code in check?
