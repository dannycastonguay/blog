**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic illustration of a programmer working on a complex codebase, showing the struggle of understanding AI-generated code and trying to tweak it with cascading failures around him. Include visual elements representing AI tools like 'lovable' or 'Claude Code', and metaphoric representations of 'technical debt' and 'AI theory debt'. Use a monochrome or grayscale color scheme to represent the subtlety and invisibility of theory debt, with selective vibrant hues pointing towards the tools and methods to manage it. The image should clearly communicate the hidden cost and challenge of AI theory debt in software development in a way that looks authentic and valuable for Reddit community discussions. It should inspire a sense of a real-world scenario of dealing with AI theory debt, encouraging viewers to share their experiences and strategies."
