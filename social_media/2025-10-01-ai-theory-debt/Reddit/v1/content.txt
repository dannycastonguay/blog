**Title:** Understanding AI Theory Debt: A Hidden Cost in Software Development

In software development, we often hear about technical debt, but there's a newer, subtler form of debt emerging in the age of AI-augmented coding: **AI theory debt**. Here's a breakdown of what it involves and how to manage it.

**What is AI Theory Debt?**
- Technical debt refers to challenges in maintaining a codebase due to factors like developer turnover or evolving requirements.
- **AI theory debt** arises when AI tools generate code that works but lacks a deep understanding of why it works, leading to potential issues when modifications are needed.

**Key Issues with AI Theory Debt:**
- You may end up with code that functions but is hard to tweak without causing cascading failures.
- The lack of internalized theory means you spend time reverse engineering and debugging, which could have been avoided.

**Managing AI Theory Debt:**
1. **Use AI for scaffolding, not full design**: Let AI help with initial prototypes, but take charge of the complete design.
2. **Document thoroughly**: Always annotate and document the code, including metaphors, invariants, and edge cases.
3. **Refactor with understanding**: Regularly rewrite code to ensure full comprehension.
4. **Build understanding**: Create diagrams, narratives, and run experiments to develop a robust theory.
5. **Effective handover**: When passing code, include the underlying metaphors and insights, not just the code itself.

Theory debt is dangerous because it's often invisible until it's too late. It's not just about borrowing code but also understanding the insights behind it.

**Discussion Questions:**
- Have you encountered AI theory debt in your projects, and how did you address it?
- What strategies do you use to ensure comprehensive understanding when working with AI-generated code?
