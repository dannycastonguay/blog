SUBJECT: Unveiling AI Theory Debt: The Hidden Cost in Your Code

Hey there,

Ever heard of *technical debt*? It's a common term in software development, but what about *AI theory debt*? As AI tools like Lovable and Claude Code make coding feel like magic, there's a hidden cost we often overlook.

Imagine getting 90% of a working feature in minutes. It's thrilling! But do you really understand *why* the code works? Or how small tweaks might lead to a cascade of failures?

That's AI theory debtâ€”when we lose sight of the underlying theory, leaving us to pay later with debugging and blind troubleshooting.

Here's a quick guide to managing this invisible debt:

- Use AI for scaffolding, not full design
- Always annotate and document key insights
- Refactor with a full understanding
- Build your theory through diagrams and experiments
- Pass on not just code, but the guiding metaphors

Don't just borrow working code; borrow the insight too. For a deeper dive, check out our latest blog post.

Happy coding!
