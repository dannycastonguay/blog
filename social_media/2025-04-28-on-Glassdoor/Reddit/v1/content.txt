### Title: Candid Discussion on bld.ai: Addressing Glassdoor Criticisms and Moving Forward

I recently came across some negative reviews about bld.ai on Glassdoor and thought it would be beneficial to address these openly. Here are some key points and my reflections on them:

**Transparency and Accountability**
- We prioritize transparency by making all work logs, revenue, and expenses visible to the team.
- > "We haven’t underpaid anyone. Payments are objectively calculated by software, without bias."

**Common Criticisms and Responses**
1. **Late or Delayed Salaries**
   - Delays might occur with partner companies, although bld.ai ensures timely fund transfers.
2. **Internal Communication**
   - *Partially true*: The operations team is responsive, but company-wide updates from the CEO need improvement.
3. **Management Style**
   - The ops team is organized, but I, as CEO, sometimes struggle with chaotic or emotional management.
4. **Structure and Mentorship**
   - No employees; contractors should have clear project expectations. Partner companies may offer more structure.
5. **Stability Concerns**
   - Direct contractors face instability; partner companies provide more but with potentially lower immediate compensation.
6. **Professionalism and Nepotism**
   - Concerns should be emailed directly to me or the board. We lack an HR department but have policies in place.
7. **Changing Rules**
   - Core rules remain stable, though project-dependent instability exists.
8. **Project Availability**
   - No project guarantees; we’re working to improve sales and marketing efforts.
9. **Business Practices**
   - Specific examples are welcome for appropriate action.

**Positive Feedback**
- Flexible hours, remote work, and competitive compensation.
- High autonomy and professional growth opportunities.
- Transparency and a positive work environment with motivated colleagues.

While there are valid criticisms, there's also a lot of positive feedback. I am committed to improving bld.ai and appreciate the
