"A professional, realistic illustration of a Glassdoor review page showing both positive and negative feedback about bld.ai, with elements representing key criticisms and responses, such as a calendar for 'Late or Delayed Salaries', speech bubbles for 'Internal Communication', a balance scale for 'Professionalism and Nepotism', and a light bulb for 'Project Availability'. Include specific visual elements that represent the main benefits of working at bld.ai, such as a flexible clock for 'Flexible hours', a globe for 'Remote work', and a ladder for 'Professional growth opportunities'. Use a balanced color scheme of blues and greens with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the transparency and openness of the company in addressing criticisms and improving its operations, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
