"A professional, realistic illustration of a company executive standing in front of a Glassdoor logo, holding a magnifying glass that highlights reviews about the company. Show a blend of positive and negative reviews to capture the essence of the blog post. In the background, show elements of transparency such as an open book showing revenue and expenses, a clock symbolizing timely payments, and an email icon to imply open communication. Include a roller skate and juggling flaming swords to represent the chaotic management and challenges faced in the company. Use a balanced color scheme of blues and greens to represent transparency and growth, with bright accents to symbolize constructive criticism and change. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of learning from criticism and improving the company, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for LinkedIn's professional networking environment with a clean, corporate-friendly aesthetic."
