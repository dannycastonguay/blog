SUBJECT: Addressing Feedback: A Transparent Look at bld.ai

Hey there,

We know that bld.ai has received some harsh reviews on platforms like Glassdoor. I’ve chosen not to respond until now, as I believe in transparency paired with accountability through identity. Here’s my candid take on the situation:

- We've always been transparent. Our work logs, revenue, and expenses are open to the team. Changes, like our shift from employees to contractors, were communicated clearly.

- Payment issues? Payments from bld.ai have always been timely. Delays might occur with partner companies, but we’re prompt.

- Communication needs work. Our ops team handles urgent matters swiftly, but I, as CEO, admit to lapses in company-wide communication. I'm working on this.

- Management style? While our ops team is organized, I can be chaotic and emotional. If you have unresolved issues, reach out directly.

- No employees means no mentorship, but project expectations should be clear. If not, notify your project admin.

- Stability is a concern for direct contractors. Partner companies offer more stability, albeit with different compensation structures.

- No HR department here, but for professionalism or nepotism concerns, email me directly.

- Rules haven't changed much, but client project instability can affect us. Partner companies offer more stability.

- Securing projects is tough. We’ve relied on referrals so far, but we’re aware improvements are needed.

Despite the criticisms, there’s also plenty of positive feedback:

- Flexible hours and remote work
- High autonomy and growth opportunities
- Transparency in operations and finance
- Talented, motivated colleagues

I genuinely appreciate the feedback and care shown, even when it’s critical. I’m committed to improving bld.ai and welcome your thoughts. Feel free to reach out directly to me.

Thank you for being part of our journey.

Warm regards, 

[CEO's Name]
