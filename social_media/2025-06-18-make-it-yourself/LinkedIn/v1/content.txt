**Version 1: Thoughtful and Insightful**

Ever wondered how to create something people truly want? As I’ve discovered, the journey often begins with getting your hands dirty. Dive in and build it yourself with AI platforms like lovable.dev or Claude Code. When the frustration peaks, don't hesitate to bring a fresh developer on board. Prioritize communication and management to drive success. Curious about sourcing talent from the Global South? Let's discuss!

**Version 2: Self-Deprecating**

If you’d asked me 6 months ago how to make something people want, I’d have had a different (and likely wrong) answer! Fast forward to today, and I’ve learned a thing or two. Start building yourself, then get a developer when you hit the wall. Keep it simple with daily check-ins. Trust me, if I can figure it out, so can you! Need help finding talent? Ping me—I promise not to break anything this time.

**Version 3: Short and Witty**

Want to build something people crave? Easy: start building, get frustrated, hire a developer, and keep meetings short. Think of it as DIY app-building therapy. Need a dev from the Global South? Call me—I’m not as clueless as I was 6 months ago! 🛠️
