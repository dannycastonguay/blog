In the fast-paced world of app development, building something people truly want is an art and a science. Six months ago, my approach would have been different, but today it's about starting with your own hands. Platforms like lovable.dev and Claude Code empower you to build without coding experience. Once you hit a wall, hire a reliable developerâ€”not a high-powered CTO. Daily check-ins and a hands-on approach can transform small AI-powered teams into industry leaders.

Curious to know how everyone is adapting their development strategies in this AI-driven era?
