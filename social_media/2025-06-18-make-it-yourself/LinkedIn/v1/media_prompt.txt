**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic illustration of an individual engaging in the process of building an app using AI platforms like lovable.dev or Claude Code. The image should capture the initial enthusiasm, followed by the frustration that ultimately leads to the decision to hire a developer. Include visual elements that represent the daily check-ins and simple management process, such as a calendar marked with daily meeting schedules and a task checklist. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the journey of DIY app-building as a form of 'therapy', highlighting both the challenges and the breakthroughs, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
