**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"A professional, realistic depiction of an individual diving into app development using AI-based platforms like lovable.dev or Claude Code. Show the individual explaining their idea in plain language to the AI, and include elements that represent the front and back ends of an app being built. Include visual cues for platforms like Python, Vercel/Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI/Anthropic, or PyTorch. When frustration sets in, illustrate the transition from solo development to the hiring of a reliable and affordable developer. Show the daily check-ins with the developer, emphasizing effective management and guidance. Use a modern, clean design with a color scheme that's vibrant yet professional. The image should clearly communicate the hands-on approach to building an app that people want, highlighting the roles of AI, personal involvement, and effective team management. The design should be professional and suitable for a LinkedIn audience, emphasizing the empowerment of small teams in the AI-driven era and the resulting industry-leading potential."
