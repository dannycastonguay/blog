**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic visual of a person building an AI-powered app on a digital interface, showing the individual actively involved in creating and testing the app. Include visual elements that represent the AI tools mentioned in the post such as lovable.dev, v0, Cursor, and Claude Code. Also, depict the interaction with a developer, symbolizing the hiring and management process. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main steps involved in building an app people want in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Emphasize the concepts of being hands-on, embracing frustration, efficient management, and taking real ownership. The design should promote discussion and engagement, reflecting the educational and community-focused nature of Reddit content."
