**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"A professional, realistic illustration showing a person (representing the visionary or entrepreneur) involved in various stages of building an app using AI. The image should depict the person first working hands-on with platforms like lovable.dev or Cursor, then hiring a developer (perhaps shown as a silhouette with a globe, indicating the Global South), having daily check-ins with them, taking ownership, and finally, engaging with users to improve the user experience. The illustration should include specific visual elements that represent the main frameworks or tools discussed, such as Python, Vercel/Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI/Anthropic, or PyTorch. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit/value proposition from the social media content, which is the strategic approach to building a product that resonates with users. The final image should look authentic and valuable for social media, emphasizing the educational value, community relevance, and authentic presentation suitable for Reddit community discussions."
