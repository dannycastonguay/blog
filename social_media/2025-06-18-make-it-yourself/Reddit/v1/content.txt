**Title: How to Build Something People Want: A 5-Step Guide**

In today's fast-paced tech world, creating something people truly want requires a strategic approach. Here's a concise guide to help you build a product that resonates with users, especially when working with AI and app development.

### **Step 1: Start by Building it Yourself**
- Jump into development using platforms like [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev) or [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/en).
- **No coding experience needed**: Let AI assist you with both front and back ends.
- *Embrace the frustration* as part of the learning process.

### **Step 2: Get Your First Developer**
- When you're stuck, hire a reliable and affordable developer.
- Avoid random hires; connect with known networks, especially in the Global South.
- > "Expect to pay around $2,000 per month… anything above $3,000 means you’re probably overpaying."

### **Step 3: Daily Check-Ins and Simple Management**
- Hold 30-minute daily meetings to review progress and set realistic tasks.
- Focus on priorities to avoid overwhelming your developer.
- Small, AI-powered teams can outperform larger ones.

### **Step 4: Take Real Ownership**
- Treat every resource as your own and stay deeply involved.
- Dedicate 10-20 hours per week to guide your developer effectively.
- Provide clear vision and ensure accountability.

### **Step 5: Improve the User Experience**
- A good product attracts users; if it doesn’t, reassess your vision or UX.
- Seek feedback from seasoned UX designers for improvements.
- Stay hands-on and continue iterating.
