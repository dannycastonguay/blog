🔥 Ready to bring your big idea to life? Here’s the secret sauce to making something people actually want! 🚀

✨ **Step 1: Dive In Head First**  
Don't wait! Use platforms like Lovable.dev and Claude Code to build it yourself. No coding skills? No problem. Let AI be your guide. Yes, you might hit a wall, but that’s part of the journey! 💪

👨‍💻 **Step 2: Hire Your First Developer**  
When you’re stuck, bring in some help. Think new talent from the Global South – reliable and affordable. Forget the pricey CTOs for now. Get someone passionate who’s ready to roll up their sleeves with you! 🌍

🗓️ **Step 3: Keep It Simple**  
Daily 30-minute check-ins. Set small, achievable goals. Don’t overload your team with features. Prioritize and execute. Remember, small and mighty teams can outshine the big guys! ✨
