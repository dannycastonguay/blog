**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic visual of a diverse team building an app, showing a hands-on founder at the helm, guiding the development process with the help of AI platforms. Include elements representing key tools like Python, Vercel/Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI/Anthropic, or PyTorch, and a developer from the Global South actively working on the project. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with a clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the essence of 'building something people want' by staying involved, testing daily, and prioritizing UX, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Optimized for Twitter timeline display with high contrast and bold visual elements, ensure it's a shareable design that stands out in a social media feed with clear focal points that work in thumbnail size."
