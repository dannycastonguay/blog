SUBJECT: 5 Steps to Create Something People Want

Ever wondered how to build something people truly want? Here's a quick guide that could change your game, especially if you're diving into the world of app development combined with AI. Let's see how you can make your idea a reality today.

Step 1: Start by Building it Yourself

Don't wait for others to bring your idea to life. Use platforms like lovable.dev or v0.dev to jump in. Trust AI to help you build, even if you're not a coding expert. Embrace the frustration; it's part of the learning.

Step 2: Get Your First Developer

When you hit a wall, hire a developer. No need for a CTO with decades of experience. Find someone reliable and affordable. Expect to pay around $2,000 per month. If you need help, reach out for recommendations.

Step 3: Daily Check-Ins and Simple Management

Hold 30-minute daily meetings, five days a week. Review completed tasks, agree on the next steps, and keep tasks manageable. Small, focused teams can outperform large ones.

Step 4: Take Real Ownership

If you're investing your own money, treat resources as your own. Keep clients updated and involved. Your role is to provide vision, guidance, and testing.

Step 5: Improve the User Experience

If your product is valuable, people will want it. If not, seek feedback or a better UX designer. Stay involved and hands-on.

Stay motivated, keep pushing, and make something incredible!
