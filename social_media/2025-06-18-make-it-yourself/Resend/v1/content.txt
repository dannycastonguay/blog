SUBJECT: Want to Build Something People Love? Here's How!

If you’d asked me how to make something people want six months ago, my answer would’ve been different. Things move quickly, especially when building an app combined with AI. So, let's dive into how you can create something people truly desire today.

Step 1: Start by Building it Yourself

Jump in and bring your idea to life using platforms like lovable.dev, v0.dev, Cursor, or Claude Code. No coding experience? No problem! Use plain language to guide the AI in building both the front and back ends. Prepare for some frustration, but remember, that's part of the journey.

Step 2: Get Your First Developer

When you hit a wall, hire your first developer. Skip the hunt for a seasoned CTO. Instead, find someone reliable and affordable. Expect to pay around $2,000 per month. A fresh grad might cost $1,000, but anything over $3,000 is likely too much. Need help finding someone? Reach out if you know me.

Step 3: Daily Check-Ins and Simple Management

Hold 30-minute meetings daily, five days a week. Here’s the format:

1. Review what was completed in the last 24 hours. Test it!
2. Agree on the next steps.
3. Set realistic, one-day tasks.

Keep it simple. Focus on prioritizing and executing. Small, AI-powered teams can outperform large traditional ones. Just look at Telegram with its 30 employees!

Step 4: Take Real Ownership

Treat every dollar and resource as if they’re your own. Keep clients updated weekly and involve them in meetings. Don’t just aim to satisfy—stay accountable and deeply involved.

Spend 10-20 hours per week effectively guiding your full-time developer. Your role is to provide vision, guidance, and testing. Stay involved, stay hands-on, and keep pushing forward.
