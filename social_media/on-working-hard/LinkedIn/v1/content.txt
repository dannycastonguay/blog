"Work smart, not hard" is a common adage, but what if the real key to success is doing both? My upbringing taught me that working hard is foundational—not just in the professional arena, but in life itself. The journey to mastery requires grit, repetition, and a mindset that embraces both effort and sustainability.

Your internal judge determines your commitment, and working hard is ultimately a choice. It's akin to a placebo effect—believing you can achieve makes the difference. This applies to everything, from building startups to nurturing relationships.

Yet, balance is crucial. Embrace the 80% rule: work hard enough to make progress, but not so hard that you burn out. This approach ensures longevity and minimizes regret.
