"A professional, realistic visual of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta glasses while operating a ship, reflecting the blend of human expertise and wearable technology in offshore operations. The image should show the person interacting with the glasses, highlighting specific functions like capturing pictures, making calls, or accessing AI interfaces. Include elements to represent the shift from Behavior-Based Safety to human performance, such as a symbolic switch or a transformation icon. Use a modern, clean design with a color palette that matches the Ray-Ban brand and a nautical theme. The image should clearly communicate the potential impacts and opportunities offered by wearable technology in industries like shipping, as emphasized in the social media content, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Aim for a professional, business-focused design suitable for LinkedIn's corporate environment, with modern business graphics and a sophisticated aesthetic that enhances professional credibility."
