### Title: How Wearable Tech is Revolutionizing Offshore Operations and Beyond

In a recent discussion with an offshore operator in Singapore, the conversation took a fascinating turn toward the evolving role of technology in the maritime industry. Despite advancements, the human element remains crucial, yet a new wave of wearables might redefine industry standards.

**Key Points:**

- **Human Factor in Technology**: 
  - > "No matter how much technology you give people, people remain a major factor in the equation."
  - *Tacit knowledge* possessed by skilled crew members is irreplaceable by AI today.

- **Safety Dynamics**: 
  - Shift from Behavior-Based Safety (BBS) to *human performance* approaches.
  - Focus on improving systems rather than blaming individuals for near misses.

- **Emergence of Wearables**: 
  - Wearables are becoming integral, much like consumer tech—think fitness trackers and smart glasses.
  - The new **Ray-Ban Meta glasses** could potentially replace phones as primary devices.

- **Real-World Applications**: 
  - Wearables are transforming everyday tasks:
    - "I now take more pictures with my glasses than with my phone."
    - While biking, glasses enable live video calls, showing what the wearer sees.
    - At airports, glasses can interpret plane tickets using OCR, enhancing convenience.

- **Integration with LLMs**: 
  - Glasses serve as interfaces to Large Language Models (LLMs), providing hands-free interaction.
  - Despite some limitations, they offer a new level of convenience.

- **Future Implications**: 
  - As connectivity improves globally (e.g., Starlink on ships, 5G everywhere), wearables will drive significant industry changes.
  - Companies that adapt without excessive spending will gain competitive advantages.
