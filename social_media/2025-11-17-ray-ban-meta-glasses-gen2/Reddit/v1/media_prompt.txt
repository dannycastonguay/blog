"A professional, realistic illustration of an offshore ship operator wearing the Ray-Ban Meta glasses, showcasing the glasses' key features such as taking photos, making calls, and interpreting plane tickets using OCR. Include elements such as Starlink satellites and 5G signals to represent the increasing connectivity in remote locations. Use a vibrant yet professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the transformative potential of wearable technologies in industries heavily reliant on skilled labor, like maritime operations, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Incorporate an infographic-style layout highlighting the key points from the social media content, such as the shift from BBS to human performance, the integration with LLMs, and the future implications of global connectivity. The design should be educational, informative, and suitable for Reddit community discussions, with a non-promotional aesthetic that provides genuine value and encourages discussion and engagement."
