"A professional, futuristic depiction of a person wearing Ray-Ban Meta glasses in an offshore operational setting. The person should be captured doing activities typical in such a setting, such as navigating a ship or communicating with crew members, with clear indication that these tasks are being facilitated by the glasses. Include visuals of the glasses interacting with the environment, such as recognizing objects or displaying information relevant to the task at hand. Use a vibrant yet professional color scheme that gives a sense of advanced technology and innovation. The image should clearly communicate the transformative power of wearable technologies in enhancing human performance and efficiency, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Optimized for Twitter timeline display with high contrast and bold visual elements. The design should be professional, shareable, and work well on mobile devices."
