When it comes to giving feedback, most of it can be organized into a simple two-by-two grid. Picture this:

- One axis: *Agreement vs. Disagreement*
- Other axis: *Effort vs. No Effort*

The bottom left is where most feedback lands—common, yet mostly useless. You agree and suggest something missing, like: "This is good. Did you think about adding X?" While it feels helpful, it's often not. Ideas are cheap, and you're pushing work back onto someone who's already done their part.

A step up is when you agree *and* do the work: "This is good. Here is a sentence you can add." By making feedback actionable, you save them time and genuinely help.

Now, if you disagree but don't do the work, there's still value: "I think this part is wrong." Thoughtful disagreement can surface real issues they might have missed.

But the gold standard? Disagree *and* do the work. Point out what's wrong and propose a better version. Rewrite, fix logic, sketch alternatives—show how you'd tackle the problem.

This framework is versatile. It applies to everything from presentations to parenting. Feedback done right can be transformative.
