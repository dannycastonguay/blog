**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic image depicting a two by two feedback matrix with 'Agreement vs Disagreement' and 'Effort vs No Effort' as the axes. The four quadrants should represent different types of feedback: 'Agree, No Effort', 'Agree, Effort', 'Disagree, No Effort', and 'Disagree, Effort', with each one showing specific elements that represent the key value/learning from the post: a light bulb for ideas, a clock for time saved, a flaw or crack for issues identified, and a golden star for the golden standard. Include symbols that represent different fields like writing, design, or problem-solving, to show the applicability of the framework. Use a vibrant, but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of giving effective feedback in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."

**INSTAGRAM ENHANCEMENT:** 
"Adapt the above media prompt to create an Instagram-worthy image with a square format optimized for Instagram feed display. Keep the design visually striking with bright, vibrant colors that pop, ensuring high visual appeal and a polished, professional quality. The image should inspire viewers to engage with it, either by liking, commenting, or sharing, and should be adaptable for Instagram Stories. Maintain the modern, aspirational aesthetic that fits Instagram's visual culture."
