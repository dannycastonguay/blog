"A professional, realistic diagram of a 2x2 feedback matrix showing the spectrum of agreement vs disagreement and effort vs no effort with four quadrants representing different types of feedback. Include specific visual elements that represent the main concepts discussed such as a check mark for agreement, a cross for disagreement, a brain for thought and a gear for effort. Use a blue and white color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the impactful method of providing feedback in a way that promotes collaboration and drives progress. This image should be suitable for LinkedIn's corporate environment with a clean, sophisticated aesthetic that enhances professional credibility and emphasizes the value of thoughtful feedback in professional growth."
