"A professional, realistic illustration of a two by two feedback matrix showing the four quadrants of feedback: agreement with no effort, agreement with effort, disagreement with no effort, and disagreement with effort. Include specific visual elements that represent the main concepts from the post, such as a lightbulb for ideas, a clock for time saved, and a pencil for doing the work. Use a clean, modern design with a corporate color scheme suitable for LinkedIn. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of providing actionable feedback (whether in agreement or disagreement) in a way that looks authentic, valuable, and enhances professional credibility for social media."
