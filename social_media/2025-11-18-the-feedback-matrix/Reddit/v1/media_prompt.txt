"A professional, realistic 2x2 matrix illustrating the four types of feedback described in the blog post. Each quadrant should represent a different feedback type: 'Agreement + No Effort', 'Agreement + Effort', 'Disagreement + No Effort', and 'Disagreement + Effort'. For each quadrant, include icons or simple visual elements that represent the key characteristics of each feedback type, such as a light bulb for ideas, a gear for effort, an X mark for disagreement, and a check mark for agreement. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme to distinguish between the quadrants. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of understanding how to give effective feedback in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Enhance the image with an educational, infographic-style design suitable for Reddit community discussions, using clear, readable graphics that support learning and understanding. The design should encourage discussion and engagement and respect Reddit's community-friendly, non-promotional aesthetic."
