"A professional, realistic illustration of a two by two feedback matrix showing specific elements that represent agreement, disagreement, effort, and no effort. Include visual elements that represent the transition from simple feedback to constructive feedback, such as a pencil, a lightbulb, or a hand offering help. Use a professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the importance of not just pointing out flaws but also contributing to the solution, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Optimized for Twitter timeline display with high contrast and bold visual elements. Professional, shareable design that stands out in a social media feed. Mobile-optimized with clear focal points that work in thumbnail size."
