**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic illustration of a journey towards a million dollars, showing a figure pursuing different paths marked with the principles discussed in the post - ignoring the million, being contrarian, accepting hardship, focusing on one problem, and utilizing an unfair advantage. Include elements that represent the example of the Gen Z individual, such as listening to others in a community setting. Use a vibrant, motivational color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the idea of creating value and solving real problems rather than chasing money, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Ensure the design is educational, informative, and suitable for Reddit community discussions, encouraging further thought and engagement."
