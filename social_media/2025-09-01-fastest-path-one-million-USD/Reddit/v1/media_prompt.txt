**MEDIA PROMPT:**

Create a professional, realistic illustration showing a person following a path marked with milestones that represent the five principles discussed in the blog post: Ignoring the Million, Being Contrarian, Embracing the Challenge, Focusing on One Problem, and Leveraging an Unfair Advantage. The path should lead up to a mountain peak symbolizing the creation of one million in value. Include elements that demonstrate the example given in the post - a young woman speaking into a microphone, symbolizing her offering of listening services, with people eagerly tuning in. Use a vibrant yet professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of solving real problems with an entrepreneurial mindset, as outlined in the social media content, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. 

For Reddit, adapt this image into an infographic-style layout with clearly marked educational sections for each principle. Add a section at the bottom for discussion questions. Use a professional but approachable visual style that respects Reddit culture, with clear, readable graphics that support learning and understanding. The infographic should encourage community engagement and discussion about the principles and their application.
