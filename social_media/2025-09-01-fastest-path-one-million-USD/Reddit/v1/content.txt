**Title: How to Make a Million Dollars: Focus on Value, Not the Number**

In a world obsessed with quick riches, it's crucial to focus on creating real value instead of just chasing a million dollars. Here's a breakdown of principles that guide you to not just one million, but potentially ten or even a hundred million.

1. **Ignore the million.** 
   - > "A million is just a proxy for value." 
   - You can't reach it through sheer hard work alone; grinding through traditional paths like school and a job may eventually get you there, but that's the slow way.

2. **Be contrarian and entrepreneurial.** 
   - Don't follow the crowd. Doing something different and thinking outside the box can set you apart.

3. **Accept that it will be hard.**
   - *If you want to move fast, you first have to move slow.* Much like learning a martial art, mastery comes from patient repetition and persistence even when you face losses.

4. **Focus on one problem, not a fixed solution.**
   - Fall in love with the problem and solve it repeatedly for various people. Start manuallyâ€”sell and deliver the solution yourself to understand it deeply.

5. **Start from an unfair advantage.**
   - Utilize what you already know or have access to, whether it's a family business, industry experience, or personal insights.

The most direct way to create a million in value is by starting a business. The business world values those who are contrarian, hardworking, and problem-focused.

**Concrete Example:** 
A Gen Z individual understood the problem of being heard, particularly for those who can't afford therapy. Instead of building an app, she started offering ten-minute listening sessions. By consistently showing up and solving a real problem, she found success and the potential for scaling her solution.

**Discussion Questions:**
- What personal or professional experiences have given you an "unfair advantage" in solving a problem?
- How can you apply
