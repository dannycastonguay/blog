SUBJECT: The Fastest Way to a Million: It's Not What You Think

At BLD.ai, we collaborate with builders—product managers, designers, and developers. Our culture is hands-on, flat, and fast, where interesting, challenging work is the norm.

Ever wondered how to make a million dollars quickly? It's not just about the money; it's about creating value that can grow into tens or hundreds of millions. These principles apply to everyone, including my own kids.

1. *Ignore the million*. It's just a value proxy. Grinding through traditional paths is slow. 

2. *Don't follow; be contrarian*. Do something different and entrepreneurial.

3. *Accept it will be hard*. Moving fast starts with moving slow, like perfecting a Jiu Jitsu move.

4. *Focus on one problem*. Fall in love with it. Solve it repeatedly. Start manually; sell and deliver it yourself.

5. *Start from an unfair advantage*. Leverage what you already know or have access to.

The answer? Start a business. It's the most direct way to create value. The world needs contrarian thinkers who solve real problems with focus and hard work.

Consider this: A Gen Z I know, deeply understands the need for being heard, a result of her struggles with mental health. Many can't afford therapy but need someone to listen. She started by offering ten-minute listening sessions at affordable prices. 

The fastest path isn't an app; it's starting small and consistent. Show up every day, take notes, see patterns. As you solve a real problem, the money follows. Ten clients become a hundred, then a thousand. Prove the problem is real, and investors and partners will notice.

That's how you make a million dollars fast—not by chasing the number, but by solving a problem with focus, hard work, and an edge.
