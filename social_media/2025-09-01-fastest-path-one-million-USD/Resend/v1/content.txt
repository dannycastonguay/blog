SUBJECT: The Secret to Making a Million: It's Not What You Think

At bld.ai, we're all about builders. From product managers to mobile developers, we thrive on hands-on, fast-paced, and exciting work. Our focus? Solving real problems in innovative ways.

So, what’s the fastest way to make a million dollars? Surprise! It's not just about the money. It's about creating value and setting yourself up for even greater success. 

Here’s the scoop:

1. *Ignore the million.* Think value, not just dollars. Hard work alone won't cut it.
   
2. *Be contrarian.* Stand out. Be entrepreneurial. Dare to be different.

3. *Embrace the grind.* Like Jiu Jitsu, master your craft slowly, then speed comes naturally.

4. *Problem over solution.* Fall in love with solving problems. Do it manually at first.

5. *Leverage your edge.* Use your unique experiences or insights to your advantage.

The answer? Start a business. It’s the most direct path to creating value. 

Take, for example, a Gen Z entrepreneur who understood the deep need for affordable, accessible listening services. Instead of building an app, she started by simply *listening*. Consistency and dedication turned her idea into a scalable solution.

Remember, it’s not about chasing numbers. Focus on solving a problem with dedication and a unique edge, and the million will follow.
