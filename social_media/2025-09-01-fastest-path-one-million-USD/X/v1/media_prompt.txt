**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic illustration of a path leading towards a treasure chest filled with gold coins, symbolizing one million dollars. The path should be marked by signposts, each representing the five principles discussed in the blog post: ignoring the million, being contrarian, accepting the hardship, focusing on one problem, and starting from an unfair advantage. The path should start from a small humble community and gradually lead towards a larger, more vibrant cityscape, indicating growth and progress. Include small characters along the path, representing individuals persistently working on different tasks and overcoming challenges. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of focusing on solving real problems with passion and an edge to achieve financial success in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Optimized for Twitter timeline display with high contrast and bold visual elements, ensuring a mobile-optimized, clear focal point that stands out in a social media feed."
