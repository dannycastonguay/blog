🌟 Ever wondered what education could look like if we mixed tradition with innovation? 🤔

Today, our parent-teacher meeting left us buzzing with ideas! The experience here is refreshingly different from what we knew in the U.S.—more rigorous yet open to innovation. 🇸🇬✨

Key Takeaways:
1️⃣ Respect and focus: The kids are more respectful and less distracted, creating a perfect environment for learning. 🧘‍♂️📚
2️⃣ Outdoor adventures: School camps with rock climbing and canoeing are on the agenda, reminding us of the joy and growth from our childhood trips! 🌲🚣‍♀️
3️⃣ Room for improvement: While the system excels in discipline, we see opportunities to foster creativity and entrepreneurship, moving beyond standardized tests. 🚀💡

To shake things up, we're exploring an alternative track with bld.ai school, combining traditional subjects with project-based learning and real-world ventures. 🤝🎨

Could this blend of respect, adventure, and innovation be the future of education? Share your thoughts! 💬
