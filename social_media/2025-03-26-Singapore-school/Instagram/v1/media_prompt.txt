**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"Produce a vibrant, professional image showing a dynamic, innovative classroom in Singapore, filled with respectful, focused students engaged in both traditional and creative learning activities. The classroom should have a sense of peace and focus, contrasted with elements of adventure and exploration representing outdoor school camp activities like rock climbing and canoeing. Include visual elements that suggest the integration of entrepreneurship education, such as a mini market stand run by students, or a student presenting a project to their peers. Use a bright and vibrant color scheme with clean, modern design to exude a sense of excitement and innovation. The image should clearly communicate the blend of respect, adventure, and innovation in education, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Also incorporate elements that align with the alternative learning track at bld.ai school, such as yoga mats, a jiu jitsu area, or spaces for collaborative project-based learning. The overall aesthetic should be polished, inspirational and 'Instagram-worthy', with a square or vertical format optimized for Instagram feed display."
