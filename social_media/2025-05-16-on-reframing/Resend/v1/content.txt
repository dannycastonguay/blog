SUBJECT: The Magic of Letting Go: Discover Something Better

Sometimes, you have to *let go* of what you want to discover something even better.

Our brains love to plan. We set goals, chase them, and craft stories around our desires. These stories often become part of who we are. But what happens when life throws us a curveball? We feel stuck, dwelling on what we can’t have. Yet, often, a new, more exciting desire emerges.

Here's the good news: you don’t have to wait for setbacks. You can choose to step back. Pause the chase, even briefly, and create space for something new—something you might like even more.

This morning in Guam, I faced a dilemma. Taxis are expensive here—two kilometers can cost $25! Wrestling with taxi apps, I realized maybe I was looking at this wrong. Letting go of the taxi idea, I discovered renting a car was cheaper. And guess what? It led to a fantastic local meal just a hundred meters away—one of the best I’ve had here.

Nothing went as planned, yet by letting go of my original desires, I found better outcomes: a rental car and a great meal. It's funny how things work out once you stop trying to control everything.

Letting go might just lead you to discover something wonderful.
