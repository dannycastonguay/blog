SUBJECT: Discover Something Better by Letting Go

Have you ever found yourself stuck, chasing after something you think you want, only to feel blocked by setbacks? Our latest blog post explores this very dilemma and how stepping back can lead to unexpected, better outcomes.

*Our brains love plans. We set goals and weave them into our identity. But sometimes, life throws us a curveball, forcing us to reconsider what we truly want.*

Here's the catch: You don't have to wait for a setback. You can choose to pause, step back, and open yourself up to new possibilities. By doing so, you might just discover something even more rewarding.

In the realm of cognitive behavioral therapy, concepts like *cognitive defusion* and *cognitive restructuring* teach us to see thoughts as just thoughts and reframe our beliefs. Similarly, mindfulness encourages *non-attachment* and *letting go of clinging* to rigid desires, opening us up to the present moment.

Want a real-life example? This morning in Guam, I faced an unexpected challenge. Taxis were expensive and local apps seemed unhelpful. Instead of stressing, I let go of my plan and discovered that renting a car was a better option. This little shift led me to a fantastic local meal and a more enjoyable day.

This blog post itself is a testament to the power of letting go. I didn't plan to write it; it just flowed once I stopped trying to control everything.
