Our latest blog post explores why sometimes letting go can lead you to even better outcomes.\n\n- Our minds love to plan and set goals. It becomes part of who we are.\n- Setbacks often force us to rethink our desires and open us up to new possibilities.\n- But here's the twist: you don't have to wait for a setback to discover something better.\n\nBy choosing to pause and step back, you create room for new, exciting opportunities.\n\n---\n\nThis idea connects with concepts like *cognitive defusion* and *cognitive restructuring* in therapy, and *non-attachment* in mindfulness. It's all about seeing thoughts as just thoughts and reframing them to release rigid desires.\n\n---\n\nA little story from my morning in Guam: I was stuck trying to find an expensive taxi. Instead, I let go, rented a car, and discovered a local eatery nearby that turned out to be amazing! Nothing went as planned, but it ended up being a fantastic experience.\n\nLetting go, even just a little, can open doors to unexpected joys. Check out the full post to dive deeper into this idea!",
