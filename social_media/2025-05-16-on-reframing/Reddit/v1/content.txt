**Title: How Letting Go of Expectations Can Lead to Better Outcomes**

Life often teaches us that while planning is essential, sometimes stepping back can lead to unexpected and better results. Here's a reflection on how letting go of rigid desires can open doors to new opportunities.

**Key Points:**

- **The Nature of Planning:**
  - Our brains are wired to set goals and chase them.
  - We often create stories about what we want and why it matters, integrating these desires into our identity.

- **The Role of Setbacks:**
  - Setbacks can force us to reconsider our desires.
  - While setbacks are often seen negatively, they can pivot us toward something better.

- **Proactive Letting Go:**
  - You don’t have to wait for setbacks to reassess your goals.
  - By choosing to pause and step back, even briefly, you create space for new discoveries.
  - > "When you stop obsessing over that thing you’re after, you create space to discover something new."

- **Cognitive and Mindfulness Approaches:**
  - *Cognitive defusion* and *cognitive restructuring* help view thoughts as just thoughts and reframe beliefs.
  - Mindfulness emphasizes *non-attachment* and releasing rigid desires to embrace the present moment.

- **A Personal Anecdote:**
  - In Guam, the struggle with expensive taxis led to the discovery of affordable car rentals.
