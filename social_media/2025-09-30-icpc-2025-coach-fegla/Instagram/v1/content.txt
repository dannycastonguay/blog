🎯 Ready to unlock the secrets of becoming a top-notch problem solver in a world of AI? 🚀

I recently had an eye-opening chat with Coach Fegla at the 2025 ICPC World Finals in Baku. His insights on competitive programming and learning in an AI-driven world were nothing short of inspiring. Here's what I learned:

1️⃣ **Embrace a Hybrid Learning Approach:** Don't just rely on AI or go solo. Rotate through easy, medium, and hard problems to build a solid foundation. Use AI as a coach, not a crutch. 🧠

2️⃣ **Start Early for Future Problem Solvers:** Encourage kids to dive into logic and math early. Transition to coding languages like C/C++ when they're ready. Foundations first, tools second. 🏗️

3️⃣ **For Business Leaders:** Prioritize hiring for problem-solving skills. Tools come and go, but precise thinking is timeless. Pair teams with AI to support, not replace, human decision-making. 🏢
