**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"A professional, realistic illustration of a gold medal with the ICPC World Finals logo, surrounded by abstract representations of complex programming challenges and AI elements. Show a mix of easy, medium, and hard problem icons, representing the three kinds of problems discussed in the post. Include visual elements that represent AI as both a coach and a competitor, such as a pair of AI 'eyes' analyzing the problems and a playful robotic hand reaching for the gold medal. Use a vibrant, tech-inspired color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the role of AI in problem-solving and competitive programming, emphasizing its current limitations and future potential in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. The design should have a professional, business-focused appeal suitable for LinkedIn's corporate environment, enhancing professional credibility with modern business graphics and corporate color schemes."
