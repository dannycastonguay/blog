SUBJECT: Unlocking the Secrets of Elite Problem Solvers

---

Earlier this month, I had the privilege of attending the 2025 ICPC World Finals in Baku. I sat down with Coach Fegla, a legend who has led teams to these prestigious finals over two decades. Our conversation was a deep dive into AI, competitive programming, and the art of teaching people to solve hard problems.

*Agentic AI* is evolving rapidly, and while it might one day snag a gold medal at the ICPC, it’s not there yet. Why? Because competitive programming challenges are a unique breed. They're crafted with precision, demanding quick, innovative thinking under tight constraints—qualities that AI struggles with since it thrives on familiar patterns.

In our chat, Coach Fegla shared valuable insights on learning in an AI-driven world. A hybrid approach is key:

1. Easy problems for honing speed and clean code.
2. Medium problems to spark creativity and modeling skills.
3. Hard problems to identify gaps in knowledge and guide future learning.

AI can be a fantastic coach, but it should never replace your own critical thinking.

For parents nurturing future problem solvers, start with logic-based play. If math and logic fascinate your child, consider introducing programming languages like C/C++ around age 10 or 11. Remember, foundations first, tools second.

Business leaders, take note:

- Hire for problem-solving prowess. Tools can be learned quickly, but precise thinking is invaluable.
- Use time-boxed problem-solving tasks during hiring to uncover modeling skills and resilience under pressure.
- Pair teams with AI for support but keep core decision-making human-centric.

There's a rich narrative behind these points. Dive deeper into our full interview on YouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=wPCikUh1pyk
