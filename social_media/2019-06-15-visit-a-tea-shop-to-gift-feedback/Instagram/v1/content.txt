🚀 Want to level up your feedback game? It’s easier than you think! 🗣️✨

Giving effective feedback can transform your relationships, both at work and in life. Here’s how you can make it a win-win for everyone:

✅ **Template for Success**: Start with these three simple steps:
1. Observe the behavior.
2. Share how it made you feel.
3. Suggest one idea for improvement.
This keeps the conversation fact-based and productive.

💡 **Strengths Framework**: Think beyond the obvious with the "A Tea Shops" framework. Is someone an Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, or perhaps an Artist? Recognizing these strengths helps tailor your feedback effectively.

🕒 **Timing Matters**: Feedback should be prompt when urgent, and scheduled regularly to foster growth over time.

Remember, receiving feedback is a gift 🎁—an opportunity to learn and improve. How do you approach giving feedback? Share your tips below! 👇
