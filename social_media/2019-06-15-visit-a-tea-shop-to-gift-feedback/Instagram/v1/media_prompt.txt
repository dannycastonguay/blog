**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"A professional, realistic illustration of a vibrant tea shop setting showing different characters representing the 'A TEA SHOPS' strength framework from the blog post. Each character (athlete, teacher, engineer, artist, scientist, human, owner, pioneer, student) should be seen performing activities that represent their traits, creating an engaging, real-world representation of the feedback concept. Include a notepad or a chalkboard showing the feedback template 'I observed..., it made me feel..., one idea to improve is...' as mentioned in the blog post. Use bright, vibrant colors with clean, modern design to align with the Instagram aesthetic. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of transforming feedback into a powerful tool for growth in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media." 

This image should be in a square format optimized for Instagram feed display, with visually striking design elements that encourage engagement and sharing. The illustration should have a modern, aspirational aesthetic that fits Instagram's visual culture, with each character representing a different strength in a memorable, relatable way.
