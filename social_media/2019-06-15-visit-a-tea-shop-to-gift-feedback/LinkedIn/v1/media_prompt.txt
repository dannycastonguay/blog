"A professional, realistic illustration of a tea shop where each customer embodies a different persona from the 'A tea shops' strength framework (Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, Student) showing their unique traits and strengths. Include specific visual elements that represent the main concept of giving and receiving feedback, such as speech bubbles with positive affirmations or constructive suggestions, and notebooks with written feedback. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of turning feedback into a strategic investment and the value of using the 'A tea shops' framework to structure feedback, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."
