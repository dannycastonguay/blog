**Version 1: Thoughtful and Insightful**

Feedback is a powerful tool for growth, benefiting both the giver and receiver. A lesson I learned as a consultant is to ground feedback in facts and empathy. Using a simple template—observe, feel, improve—can transform interactions. Remember, feedback is a gift and a chance to enhance our collective strengths.
