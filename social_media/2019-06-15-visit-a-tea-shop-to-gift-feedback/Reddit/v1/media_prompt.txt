"A professional, realistic illustration of a tea shop showing different characters representing the 'A Tea Shops' strength framework from the blog post. This includes an Athlete, Teacher, Engineer, Artist, Scientist, Human, Owner, Pioneer, and Student, each engaging in activities that reflect their strengths. Include elements that symbolize feedback exchange, such as speech bubbles or thought clouds, to tie in the concept of giving and receiving feedback. Use a warm, inviting color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of becoming stronger through effective feedback as outlined in the social media content, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media, especially for Reddit's educational and discussion-driven culture."
