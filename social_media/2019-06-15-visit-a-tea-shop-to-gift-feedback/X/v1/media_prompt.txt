**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"A professional, realistic illustration of a diverse group of people gathered around a table in a modern tea shop. Each person should represent a different profession (athlete, teacher, engineer, artist, scientist, human, owner, pioneer, student) as outlined in the "A Tea Shops" framework from the blog post. Show them engaging in a feedback session, with one person speaking and the others listening attentively. Include visual elements like a written feedback template on a notepad and a clock to represent prompt feedback delivery. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the concept of empowering team strength through effective feedback, as mentioned in the social media content, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Optimized for Twitter timeline display with high contrast and bold visual elements. The design should be professional, shareable and stand out in a social media feed. The design should be mobile-optimized with clear focal points that work in thumbnail size."
