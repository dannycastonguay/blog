"A professional, realistic depiction of a meeting room scenario showing an individual stepping forward to actively participate in a discussion within the first 5 minutes. Include visual elements such as a clock showing the time, a whiteboard with ideas being added, and other attendees listening attentively. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the importance of active participation, responsiveness, and confidence in achieving impactful communication and leadership. It should resonate with the themes of personal growth and overcoming conditioned meekness, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for a professional LinkedIn audience."
