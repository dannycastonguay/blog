### Title: How to Break Free from Conditioning and Make a Real Impact

In a world where many of us have been conditioned to stay quiet and obedient, it can be challenging to step up and create meaningful change. Here's how you can start being the change you want to see in the world.

**Key Points:**

- **Challenge Early Conditioning:** 
  - Many of us were taught to be *meek and obedient* in educational systems that didn't encourage questioning authority. 
  - This conditioning can hinder our ability to create change if we remain passive.

- **Embrace Confidence and Authenticity:** 
  - True change requires stepping into the world with *confidence* and *authenticity*, not arrogance.
  - > "Be your best self. You belong." A powerful reminder to engage and contribute actively.

- **Active Engagement in Meetings:**
  - Engage within the first five minutes of any meeting to foster an active mindset.
  - Commit to an action by the ten-minute mark to improve the groupâ€™s outcome, like a follow-up email or helpful insight.

- **Value Responsiveness Over Perfection:**
  - Don't delay responses in pursuit of perfection. People value *frequent updates* and *promptness*.
  - Especially important for technical folks who strive for efficiency; human interactions require repeated communication.

- **Provide Complete Solutions:**
  - Leaders prefer complete solutions over multiple open-ended options. Present fully resolved problems when possible for efficiency and effectiveness.

**Discussion Questions:**

1. What strategies have you used to overcome early conditioning that encouraged passivity?
2. How do you balance the need for responsiveness with the risk of over-communication in your professional and personal life?
