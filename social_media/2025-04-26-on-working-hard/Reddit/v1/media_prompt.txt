"A professional, realistic visual of an obstacle course runner navigating through various challenges representing the different aspects of life discussed in the blog post, including physical health, mental resilience, repetition, personal judgement, belief, love, and overcoming negativity. The runner should appear strong, determined, and focused, illustrating the concept of working hard. Include elements that represent the key frameworks, such as Bruce Lee's quote, the internal judge, and the placebo effect. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the importance and value of working hard, as well the balance between working hard and working smart in a way that looks authentic and valuable for Reddit community discussions. Ensure the design is educational, informative, and encourages engagement and discussion."
