"A professional, realistic image of a person undergoing physical and mental training, showing the transformation into a stronger, more resilient individual. Include elements that represent the key values of endurance, repetition, and mastery, such as a person practicing a kick multiple times, or an obstacle course in the background. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the value of hard work and resilience, as well as the power of choice in overcoming adversity, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. It should also subtly hint at the balance between working hard and working smart, aligning with the messaging in the social media content. The design should be suitable for LinkedIn's corporate environment, emphasizing expertise, authority, and professional value."
