ðŸš€ Is AI the secret to boosting economic growth, or just a tech fantasy? Let's dive into the numbers and assumptions that could reshape our future! ðŸ¤”

In a recent chat with Tyler Cowen, Jack Clark from Anthropic shared a fascinating view: AI might lift the USA's economic growth to 3-5% per year, way less than the 20-30% some tech enthusiasts dream about. Here's the scoop: 

âœ¨ 79% of Claude Code's use is for automation, not just human assistance. 
âœ¨ Startups are leading the charge, making up 33% of all sessions.
âœ¨ Even a 50% productivity boost for coders barely nudges national output.

The real game-changer? Getting AI into every corner of the service sector. Whether it's office jobs, education, or healthcare, the potential for productivity leaps is huge. But it all hinges on one thing: our willingness to embrace change.

So, what's your take? Are we ready to let AI transform our work and economy? Share your thoughts below! ðŸ‘‡
