**Version 1:**

üîç *"Is AI the future's economic engine? Maybe, but not at the speed some predict."* In a recent conversation with Tyler Cowen, Jack Clark of Anthropic suggested AI could boost U.S. economic growth by 3-5%, far below some optimistic forecasts. This calls for a deeper understanding of AI's incremental impact across sectors. Could the real gains lie not just in tech, but in transforming the broader service industry? Let's discuss: How can we unlock AI's full potential beyond coding? #AIFuture #EconomicGrowth

**Version 2:**

ü§î *"I once thought AI would skyrocket our economy overnight. Turns out, it's more like a steady climb."* In Tyler Cowen's chat with Jack Clark from Anthropic, they estimated a 3-5% growth from AI, which sounds modest compared to some dreams of 20-30%. Maybe there's more nuance to it than I first grasped. Are we overlooking the cultural shifts needed to embrace AI fully? How can industries adapt? #AIGrowth #RealisticExpectations

**Version 3:**
