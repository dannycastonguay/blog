**MEDIA PROMPT:**
"A professional, realistic illustration of a young intern stepping boldly into an unfamiliar, galaxy-themed territory, representing the risk-taking nature of entrepreneurship. The intern should be shown as stepping on stones that are shaped like common business pitfalls or mistakes, showing the concept of learning from failures. The background should be a starry sky or galaxy, symbolizing the 'shooting for the stars' and 'swinging for the fences' metaphors from the blog post. Include a light trail behind the intern, indicating the progress made despite failures, and a shining star or planet in the distance, representing the final success or breakthrough. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme, with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the concept of embracing risks and learning from failures as a necessary step in entrepreneurship, reflecting the main value proposition from the social media content. The design should be optimized for Twitter timeline display with high contrast and bold visual elements, showcasing a professional, shareable design that stands out in a social media feed."
