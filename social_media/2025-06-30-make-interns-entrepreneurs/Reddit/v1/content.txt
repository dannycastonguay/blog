**Title: Embracing Risk-Taking During Internships: An Open Letter from a Mentor**

As a mentor to interns, I've often pondered the importance of risk-taking, especially for young individuals at the start of their careers. Here's my perspective on why taking risks during internships is crucial for personal and professional development.

**Key Points:**

- **Challenge the Status Quo**: We often don't challenge young people enough. When you're starting out, you have fewer preconceived notions, making you more open to risk. This *openness* is a significant advantage.
  
  > "They are young neural nets that haven't overlearned yet!!"

- **Internships as Risk-Friendly Environments**: At our company, internships aren't just about gaining experience; they're about taking risks. You're encouraged to make mistakes, as they can lead to new, unexplored paths.

- **Entrepreneurial Mindset**: Our mission at bld.ai revolves around nurturing entrepreneurs. The goal isn't just to help interns land prestigious positions, but to instill an entrepreneurial mindsetâ€”*failing repeatedly without giving up until you succeed.*

- **Value in Breakthroughs**: True value comes not from the sheer number of hours worked, but from critical moments of breakthrough. If you spend most of your time experimenting and failing but achieve something outstanding in a few hours, you've created significant value.

  > "Ultimately, your internship should culminate in a single notable success, those critical few hours when you really shine and create a genuine difference."

**Discussion Questions:**

1. How have you approached risk-taking in your own internships or early career experiences?
2. What are some ways companies can better support interns in taking risks and learning from failures?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts and experiences!
