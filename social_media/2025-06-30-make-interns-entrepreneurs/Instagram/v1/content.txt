🚀 Are you ready to take risks and redefine success? 🚀

In a world where every step seems planned and calculated, there's unmatched power in the boldness of youth. 🌟 As a mentor to interns, I believe it's crucial to challenge the norms and encourage risk-taking. Here's why:

1️⃣ **Openness is your superpower**: When you're just starting out, you're free from the chains of preconceived notions. This fresh perspective is your greatest asset. It's the same fearless curiosity that turns startups into industry disruptors. 💡

2️⃣ **Mistakes are stepping stones**: Internships should be your playground for experimentation. It's not about avoiding mistakes; it's about learning from them. Each "failure" is just a stepping stone to innovation. 🔄

3️⃣ **The magic happens in those few hours**: True breakthroughs don't come from clocking hours but from those pivotal moments of insight. Focus on experimenting, and let those critical hours of success define your journey. ✨
