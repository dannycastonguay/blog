SUBJECT: Are You Ready to Become a Scientist?

We've just published a new article that we thought you'd enjoy. Here's the latest from our blog:

Richard Feynman's wisdom rings truer than ever in today's world of AI-driven automation. As AI takes over many traditional expert roles, from doctors to engineers, our key task is evolving: learning to question what the machine tells us.

AI provides the consensus view, drawing from vast datasets. But true knowledge emerges from skepticism, not agreement. Our job is to challenge AI's outputs by asking, "How could this be wrong?" We must experiment, test boundaries, and identify where the model fails.

This is the essence of science—testing claims with evidence. In this new era, we all become scientists by method, if not by degree.

Have you ever wondered if you're a data scientist at heart?

In a world where many claim the title, perhaps we're all heading toward roles that require scientific thinking. Whether in medicine, law, or construction, scientific work is becoming integral.

But do you *believe* in science, or in what a reputable source claims is true? Believing without questioning goes against the core of scientific inquiry. True scientists doubt and challenge their beliefs through the scientific method.

The so-called "null hypothesis" is about challenging beliefs, not defending them. It's about humility and the willingness to be wrong. It's the same principle as Hanlon’s Razor: don't assume malice when ignorance could be the cause.

Next time you hold a strong opinion, especially one backed by AI, ask yourself: am I trying to prove it or disprove it? This introspection reveals whether you're a believer or a true scientist.
