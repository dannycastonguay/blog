**MEDIA PROMPT:**

"A professional, realistic illustration of a person staring at a computer screen showing AI outputs, with question marks and thought bubbles around their head representing doubt and questioning. Include visual elements that represent the scientific method, such as an experiment setup, a graph showing data analysis, and a representation of the 'null hypothesis', perhaps symbolized by a balance scale weighing belief and doubt. Use a vibrant but professional color scheme, with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the transformation of traditional roles into a scientific approach due to AI, emphasizing the importance of doubt and questioning in this process. It should feel genuine and informative, suitable for Reddit community discussions, with a clear, readable layout that encourages engagement and discussion."
