**Version 1:**  
In an era dominated by AI, our most crucial skill isn't knowing the answers, but questioning them. As AI provides the prevailing expert views, it's our duty to interrogate these outputs. True science thrives on doubt, not agreement. Are we ready to adopt a scientist's mindset, challenging and testing AI's "truths"? Let's explore how this shift shapes our professional roles. How are you embracing this change?

**Version 2:**  
I've reviewed countless "data scientist" resumes lately, and I wonder if we're all headed thereâ€”armed with hypotheses and a healthy dose of skepticism.
