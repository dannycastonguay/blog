"A professional, realistic image of a scientist questioning a large AI machine or interface, representing the shift towards a more inquisitive, scientific mindset in the face of AI-generated answers. Include elements like hypotheses, data charts, and boundary conditions that represent the scientific method of doubting and testing. Use a modern, clean design with a color scheme of cool blues and grays to convey the technological and scientific theme. The image should clearly communicate the idea of challenging AI's 'truths' and embracing skepticism as a valuable skill in the AI-dominated era, which is the main value proposition from the social media content. This design should be professional and business-focused, suitable for LinkedIn's corporate environment, with modern business graphics that enhance professional credibility."
