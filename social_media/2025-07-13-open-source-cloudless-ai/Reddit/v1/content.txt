**Title:** Building a Powerful Local AI Workstation: Specs, Setup, and Lessons Learned

I've recently embarked on a journey to build a local workstation capable of running the largest AI models without relying on cloud services or external APIs. The goal was to harness open-source tools for full privacy and control. Here's a detailed look at my setup and some insights from the process.

**The Build:**
