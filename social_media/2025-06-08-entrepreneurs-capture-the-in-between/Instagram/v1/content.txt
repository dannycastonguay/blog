🌟 Ever wondered what it truly means to be an entrepreneur? 🤔

Turns out, it's all about finding those hidden opportunities "between" things and daring to seize them! 🚀

Think of entrepreneurs like skirmishers in ancient battles. They bravely move ahead, capturing critical ground to pave the way for others. Here’s what sets them apart:

1️⃣ Entrepreneurs spot opportunities early and take thoughtful risks. It's not about wealth, but having the clarity to see what others don't.

2️⃣ They wear many hats—adapt quickly, navigate uncertainty, and make the most of limited resources. It's about being capable, not perfect.

3️⃣ Creating impact isn't always direct. Like me, some focus on empowering others to become entrepreneurs, amplifying their reach and influence.

For instance, tackling my daughter Pascale’s eczema means looking beyond traditional treatments and experimenting with fresh ideas. It's about continuous learning and refining strategies. 🌿
