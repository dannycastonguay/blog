**MEDIA PROMPT:**
---
"Create a professional, realistic illustration showing a skirmisher standing on a hill, with a larger army waiting in the background. The skirmisher is holding a flag that symbolizes entrepreneurship, such as a flag with a lightbulb or a rocket. This represents the role of entrepreneurs as early risk-takers who seize critical opportunities ahead of others. Also, show different paths leading from the hill, symbolizing the various unconventional approaches an entrepreneur can take to address a problem, referencing the eczema example from the blog post. Use vibrant but professional colors, with the skirmisher and the flag standing out as a focal point in the image. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit/value proposition from the social media content, which is the ability of entrepreneurs to spot opportunities early, take thoughtful risks, and continuously learn through deliberate experimentation. The design should be clean and modern, suitable for both light and dark social media themes."

For Instagram: 

"Ensure the image has an Instagram-worthy aesthetic with bright, vibrant colors and high visual appeal. The image should be polished, professional quality suitable for lifestyle and inspirational content. The format should be square or vertical, optimized for Instagram feed display. The design should be visually striking, encouraging engagement and sharing. The overall aesthetic should fit Instagram's modern, aspirational visual culture, showing entrepreneurship as an exciting, inspiring journey."
