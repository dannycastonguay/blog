"A professional, realistic illustration of a startup leader juggling various elements such as team dynamics, customer satisfaction, and funds. Show the leader prioritizing a ball symbolizing 'customer happiness' over others representing 'internal politics'. Also, include a subtle depiction of a co-founder fading into the background, symbolizing the leader's readiness to assume all responsibilities. Use a vibrant, yet professional color scheme with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the main benefit of prioritizing customer satisfaction over internal politics in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media, especially for LinkedIn's corporate environment. Emphasize the leader's role in steering the startup towards success while managing co-founder dynamics."
