"A professional, realistic illustration of a startup leader focusing on customer satisfaction while juggling various tasks associated with running a business. Show the leader in a dynamic position, balancing on a tightrope or up a hill, symbolizing the challenges of startup leadership. Include elements representing customer happiness such as positive customer reviews, smiley faces, or thumbs up signs, and depictions of tasks such as project plans, research data, and team meetings. Use a color scheme that represents dynamism and success, such as vibrant yellows and blues with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate the importance of prioritizing customer satisfaction and assuming responsibility for all business tasks, as mentioned in the social media content, in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media. Ensure the design is educational, informative, and suitable for Reddit community discussions with a professional but approachable visual style that respects Reddit culture."
