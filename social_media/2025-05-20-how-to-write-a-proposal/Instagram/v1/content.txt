🚀 Struggling with proposal writing? 🤔 What if I told you there's a game-changing way to make it easier and more effective? 

At [bld.ai](https://bld.ai), our AI agent can draft proposals that are just as good as mine—no joke! Here's how I approach proposal writing to seal the deal every time:

🔍 **Pre-Meeting Prep**: Dive deep into the potential client's world. Visit their site, test their product, and jot down feedback. This lays the groundwork for a strong proposal.

🤖 **AI-Powered Drafting**: Let AI do the heavy lifting! I use our agent to craft a hypothesis on how we can help, blending our skills with their needs.

🗣️ **Authentic Communication**: It’s not just about selling; it’s about challenging the business model and adding genuine value. Honest dialogues lead to long-lasting partnerships.

Remember, clarity and authenticity are your best allies! 💡 Start your proposal with what you truly think—clients appreciate the honesty.
