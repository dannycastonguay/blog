SUBJECT: Unlock the Secrets to Winning Proposals with AI

Are you tired of the proposal writing grind? Imagine having an AI agent that crafts proposals as effectively as you do. At bld.ai, you can chat with our AI agent without even logging in. It writes proposals and so much more. I rely on it exclusively for my writing needs now.

But why do I still get asked to write proposals every week? 

It got me thinking: Is there something about my approach people want to know? In my latest blog post, I share my step-by-step algorithm for proposal writing and dive into the mindset that makes proposals truly effective.

Here's a sneak peek at my process:

1. **Pre-Meeting Prep**: Dive into the clientâ€™s world to understand their challenges. This can take 15-60 minutes but is crucial for creating value.

2. **AI-Assisted Drafting**: Use AI to draft a proposal hypothesis, leveraging both our skills and the network at bld.ai.

3. **Early Asynchronous Communication**: Share feedback and drafts early to spark client interest.

4. **Record Calls**: Capture every detail using tools like Google Gemini or granola.ai for thorough analysis.

5. **Iterate with AI**: Refine the proposal using AI insights, focusing on clarity and directness.

Beyond mechanics, proposal writing is about mindset. It's about challenging business models and being more than a "task monkey." Authenticity is key. Honest, straightforward writing beats polished ambiguity every time.

Remember, your best work often speaks volumes with fewer words. Authenticity doesn't need verbosity. 

I hope this insight helps you craft proposals that are clearer, stronger, and truly reflective of who you are. Dive into the full post to learn more.
