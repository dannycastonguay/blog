SUBJECT: Master Proposal Writing with AI: Tips and Insights

Hey there!

Ever found yourself stuck writing proposals? You're not alone! But what if I told you there's an AI agent at bld.ai that can help draft proposals and more? Trust me, it's a game-changer. I even use it for my own proposals.

Here's a sneak peek into my proposal writing strategy:

1. **Pre-Meeting Prep**: Dive into your potential client's world. Explore their website, test their product, and jot down constructive feedback. Tools like Descript can be handy!

2. **Leverage AI for Drafting**: Use an AI agent to create a proposal draft that aligns with your skills and what bld.ai offers.

3. **Kickstart Communication**: Early and detailed feedback through asynchronous communication can spark interest quickly.

4. **Record and Note**: During calls, ensure you capture everything. Tools like Google Gemini or granola.ai are perfect for this.

5. **Refine with AI**: Post-call, utilize AI to refine your proposal, focusing on solutions, milestones, and more.

Beyond tactics, it's about mindset. Authenticity and clarity are your best allies. Skip the jargon, and communicate straightforwardly. It's not just about fulfilling requests; it's about challenging and improving business models.
