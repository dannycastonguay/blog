🧘‍♀️ Ever feel like life’s a juggling act? Balancing work, yoga, and everything in between can get mentally exhausting! 🤯

While at ICPC in Baku, I realized something profound: it’s not about perfect symmetry in life, just like in yoga. It’s about reducing cognitive load and embracing balance in every moment. 🌟

✨ Here’s what I’ve learned:
1️⃣ Let go of the pressure to mirror perfectly. Whether it’s in yoga or life, focus on the principle, not the checklist. 
2️⃣ Simplify your approach. Great problem solvers, like those at ICPC, reduce unnecessary tasks to stay focused on what truly matters.
3️⃣ Trust yourself and be present. It's not about counting moves but about feeling your way through the flow. 

Yoga, coding, or any pursuit—keeping the principles and dropping the overhead can transform how you engage with it all. 🙌
