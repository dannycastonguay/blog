## üìã Overview

This project automates the process of generating and publishing social media content for blog posts. When blog posts are added, edited, or deleted in your repository, the system automatically:

1. üîç Detects changed posts (new, edited, deleted)
2. ‚úçÔ∏è Generates tailored social media content for each platform with versioning
3. üîÑ Creates a separate pull request for each post with the generated content
4. üöÄ After merging, publishes the content to configured social media platforms

## üîÑ Workflow

The system operates in a two-step workflow:

1. **Content Generation** üìù:

   - When a page is added, edited, or renamed in the `_posts` directory (either from a push to main or a PR)
   - The first GitHub Action is triggered
   - It generates social media content using AI with proper versioning
   - Creates a separate PR for each post containing the generated content
   - PR titles and branch names include the post name, version, and date

2. **Content Publishing** üì¢:
   - After the content PR is merged to main
   - The second GitHub Action is triggered
   - It publishes the content to the configured social media platforms
   - Results are recorded in the PR comments

You can check the posting results by revisiting the PR after it's merged - the results will be visible in the comments section.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites

- GitHub repository
- OpenAI API key
- Social media accounts (X, LinkedIn, etc.)

### Creating an X Account and Getting Tokens

1. **Create an X Developer Account**:

   - Go to [X Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard)
   - Sign in with your X account
   - Apply for a developer account if you don't have one

2. **Create a Project and App**:

   - In the Developer Portal, create a new Project
   - Create an App within that Project
   - Set App permissions to "Read and Write"

3. **Generate Authentication Tokens** üîë:
   - Navigate to the "Keys and Tokens" tab
   - Generate "Consumer Keys" (API Key and Secret)
   - Generate "Access Token and Secret"
   - Save all four values securely

### Environment Variables üîê

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
X_API_KEY=your_twitter_api_key
X_API_SECRET=your_twitter_api_secret
X_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_twitter_access_token
X_ACCESS_SECRET=your_twitter_access_secret
```

### Repository Settings ‚öôÔ∏è

1. **Add Environment Variables to GitHub**:

   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions
   - Add the following repository secrets:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     - `TWITTER_API_KEY`
     - `TWITTER_API_SECRET`
     - `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`
     - `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET`
     - `GH_PAT` (GitHub Personal Access Token)

2. **Creating a GitHub Personal Access Token (GH_PAT)**:

   - Go to your GitHub account settings
   - Navigate to Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
   - Click "Generate new token" and select "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Give your token a descriptive name
   - Set the expiration as needed (recommended: 90 days or custom expiration)
   - Select the following scopes:
     - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
     - `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)
   - Add this token as the `GH_PAT` secret in your repository settings

3. **Configure GitHub Actions**:
   - Ensure GitHub Actions are enabled for your repository
   - The workflows will be automatically triggered when new posts are added

## üìù Usage

### Adjusting Prompts ü§ñ

Prompts control how the AI generates content for each platform. They are located in the `prompts/` directory.

To adjust a prompt:

1. Edit the corresponding file (e.g., `prompts/X.txt` for Twitter)
2. Use `{content}` as a placeholder for the blog post content
3. Content instructions should be placed within brackets to clearly indicate what should be generated

Example prompt structure:

```
Summarize the following blog post into an engaging X post.
Use a direct, thoughtful style. Include a hook and end with a question.
It SHOULD NOT be more than 200 chars.

Blog Post:
{content}

X post:
```

### Content Versioning üìö

The system now supports versioning for social media content:

1. Content is stored in a versioned structure:

   ```
   social_media/your-page-name/X/v1/content.txt
   social_media/your-page-name/X/v2/content.txt
   ```

2. When a post is edited, a new version is automatically created
3. Version numbers are incremented sequentially (v1, v2, v3, etc.)
4. Version information is included in branch names, commit messages, and PR titles

### Adding Media to Posts üñºÔ∏è

To include media with your social media posts:

1. Add image or video files to the platform directory:

   ```
   social_media/your-page-name/X/image.jpg
   ```

   Or in the version-specific directory:

   ```
   social_media/your-page-name/X/v1/image.jpg
   ```

2. Supported formats:
   - Images: jpg, jpeg, png, gif
   - Videos: mp4, mov, avi

The system will automatically detect and attach these media files when posting.

> **Note about media files** üìå: When adding media files for posts, ensure they are in the same branch as the content for the publish workflow to detect them properly.

### Checking Posting Results üìä

After a PR with social media content is merged:

1. Go back to the PR page
2. Check the comments section to see posting results
3. Results include status, post URL, and any errors

## üîå Adding a New Platform Integration

To add support for a new social media platform:

1. **Create a Platform Class**:

   - Create a new file in `scripts/posting/platforms/` (e.g., `linkedin.py`)
   - Implement the platform class extending `SocialMediaPlatform`
   - Implement the required methods, especially `post_content()`

   Example:

   ```python
   from ..platforms import SocialMediaPlatform

   class LinkedInPlatform(SocialMediaPlatform):
       def __init__(self):
           super().__init__("LinkedIn")
           self._verify_credentials()

       def _verify_credentials(self):
           # Check for required environment variables
           pass

       def post_content(self, content, page_name, platform_folder=None):
           # Implement posting logic
           pass
   ```

2. **Register the Platform**:

   - Update `scripts/posting/poster.py` to include the new platform:

   ```python
   supported_platforms = {
       "X": TwitterPlatform,
       "LinkedIn": LinkedInPlatform,
   }
   ```

3. **Create a Prompt**:

   - Add a prompt file in the `prompts/` directory (e.g., `LinkedIn.txt`)

4. **Update Environment Variables**:
   - Add the required API keys/tokens to your `.env` file
   - Add the secrets to GitHub repository settings

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

Current limitations of the system:

- **X API Limits**: Be aware of X's API rate limits:
  - 17 posts per day for free tier accounts
  - Media uploads count toward daily limits
  - Check [X API documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/rate-limits) for the latest limits

## üìÅ Scripts Directory Overview

- `detect_new_pages.py`: Detects new, edited, and deleted posts in the repository
- `extract_social_media_content.py`: Generates versioned social media content using OpenAI
- `post_social_media.py`: Posts content to social media platforms
- `posting/`: Module containing platform implementations
  - `poster.py`: Main class for posting content with versioning support
  - `platforms/`: Directory containing platform-specific implementations
    - `twitter.py`: X platform implementation with support for versioned content

## üë®‚Äçüíª Development Guide

To set up the project for development:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. **Add environment variables**:

   - Create a `.env` file based on the variables listed above

3. **Add environment variables to GitHub**:

   - Add the required secrets to your repository settings

4. **Working with posts**:
   - Add, edit, or rename markdown files in the `_posts` directory
   - Commit and push to main or create a PR
   - The workflow will automatically:
     - Detect changes (new, edited, deleted, or renamed posts)
     - Generate versioned content for each changed post
     - Create a separate PR for each post with version information
     - Skip processing for deleted posts
   - Content will be published after the PR is merged into main

## üîÑ File Change Handling

The system handles different types of file changes:

- **New Posts**: Generates new social media content
- **Edited Posts**: Creates a new version of the social media content
- **Renamed Posts**: Treated as new posts with fresh content
- **Deleted Posts**: Skipped in the content generation process
- **Invalid Characters**: Post names with invalid Git branch characters (spaces, special characters) are automatically sanitized for branch names
- **Folder Names with Spaces**: Both the posting script and publishing workflow properly handle folder names containing spaces

## üîß Branch Name Handling

The system includes several features for handling branch names:

- **Sanitization**: Automatically replaces invalid Git branch characters (spaces, ~, ^, :, ?, \*, [, @{, \) with underscores
- **Versioning**: Includes version information in branch names (`{page_name}_{version}_{date}_social_media`)
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles cases when a branch already exists by adding a timestamp
- **Suffix Preservation**: Always maintains the required `_social_media` suffix for compatibility with other workflows
