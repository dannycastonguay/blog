# Image Generation Prompt System

## Purpose
This prompt system creates compelling visual prompts for blog post content that will be used to generate images for social media posts.

## Inputs Expected
1. **Full Blog Post Content**: The complete markdown content from the _posts/ directory
2. **Social Media Content**: The platform-specific content from content.txt (subject line, summary, key points)
3. **Image Generation Guidelines**: This prompt file with style and quality guidelines

## Output Expected
A detailed **media_prompt** that combines insights from all three inputs to create a specific image generation prompt that:
- Captures the essence and main themes of the full blog post
- Aligns with the social media content's messaging
- Follows professional visual guidelines
- Results in real, valuable images that describe the post's aim

## Guidelines for Creating Image Prompts

### Visual Quality Standards
1. Create visually appealing and professional images suitable for social media
2. Focus on real, concrete visual representations that clearly communicate the post's value
3. Use modern, clean, and engaging visual styles that look authentic and professional
4. Consider the emotional tone and key themes of the content
5. Avoid generic abstract concepts - create specific, meaningful visuals
6. Use vibrant but professional color schemes
7. Create images that would work well as thumbnails or social media posts

### Style Preferences
- Modern flat design or minimalist illustrations with real-world elements
- Professional business aesthetics that feel authentic
- Clean backgrounds with focused, meaningful subjects
- High contrast and good readability when used as thumbnails
- Suitable for both light and dark social media themes
- Real objects, scenarios, or concepts that viewers can immediately understand

### Content Integration Requirements
When creating the media_prompt, you must:
1. **Extract core concepts** from the full blog post content
2. **Identify key messaging** from the social media content
3. **Combine both** to create a visual that represents the post's actual value and purpose
4. **Ensure the image describes the aim** of the post clearly and professionally
5. **Make it valuable** - the image should help viewers understand what they'll gain

## Media Prompt Format
Create detailed image generation prompts using this structure:

"A professional, realistic [main visual concept from blog post] showing [specific elements that represent the key value/learning from the post] with [relevant objects, settings, or scenarios from the content]. Include [specific visual elements that represent the main frameworks, tools, or concepts discussed]. Use [appropriate color scheme] with clean, modern design. The image should clearly communicate [the main benefit/value proposition from the social media content] in a way that looks authentic and valuable for social media."

## Example Analysis Process
1. **From Full Post**: Extract main frameworks, tools, concepts, and learning outcomes
2. **From Social Media Content**: Identify the key value proposition and call-to-action
3. **Combine**: Create a visual that shows the practical application or benefit of the post's content
4. **Ensure Realism**: Make sure the image represents something concrete and valuable, not abstract

The final media_prompt should result in images that immediately communicate the post's value and make viewers want to engage with the content.
